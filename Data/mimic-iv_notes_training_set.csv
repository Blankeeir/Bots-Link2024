Hemodynamics: (see above) 
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA:  Normal
LAD:  99% restenosis in the mid LAD within the bare metal stent 
with TIMI 1 flow into the distal LAD. The diagonal branch 
remained patent and was a large vessel. 
LCX:  Large vessel vessel with a large OMB1 and birfurcating 
OMB/PLB to the posterior wall.  There were minor lumen 
irregularities in the LCx.
RCA:  The RCA had minor irregularities and gave rise to a small 
PDA and RPLB.

Interventional details:
The patient presented with a NSTEMI following bare metal stent 
placement in the mid LAD in ___.  She re-developed 
unstable symptoms and proceeded with cardiac catheterization.
Unfractionated heparin and eptifibatide were used for 
anticoagulation.

Using a ___ Fr XB3.5 guiding catheter and a 0.014 BMW wire, the 
LAD in-stent restenosis was dilated with a 2.5 mm Cutting 
Balloon.  A 2.5 mm x 26 mm Resolute drug eluting stent was 
placed in the mid LAD and deployed at 14 atms.  A 2.75 mm x 15 
mm balloon was inflated to 24 atms throughout the stent.   This 
resulted in no residual stenosis within the stent and TIMI 3 
flow into the distal vessel. 

The procedure was performed from the right radial artery without 
complications. 

ASSESSMENT
1. Single vessel CAD with in-stent restenosis in the bare metal 
stent in the mLAD
2. Successful drug-eluting stent of the mid LAD
PLAN
1. Aspirin indefinitely
2. Clopidogrel for up to one year

___ TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in 
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The 
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, LV 
systolic function has normalized.   
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year-old lady with a PMH of NSTEMI s/p 
BMS to mid-LAD in ___, hypothyroidism and recurrent UTIs, 
admitted with chest pain, found to have unstable angina due to 
in-stent restenosis. Admission was complicated by a urinary 
tract infection.

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
# Unstable angina: History of NSTEMI with BMS to LAD in ___, 
and presented with chest pain that was c/w prior and concerning 
for NSTEMI, as accompanied by elevated troponin (0.08). The 
timing of her symptoms was quite concerning for in-stent 
restenosis. She had no EKG changes. Her troponin initially 
trended down to 0.06, and was accompanied by a low CK-MB at 3. 
She received aspirin 325 mg PO, clopidogrel 300 mg PO, and was 
started on a heparin drip on arrival. On ___, she was taken 
to the cath lab for left heart cath. This revealed 99% 
restenosis in the mid LAD within the bare metal stent with TIMI 
1 flow into the distal LAD, with no other angiographically 
significant disease. A single drug-eluting stent was placed in 
the mid LAD. She was placed on an integrellin drip following the 
catheterization, and this therapy was complicated by some oozing 
from her peripheral IV site. She had no drop in her blood counts 
with this bleeding. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely, 
and clopidogrel should for continued for up to one year after 
discharge.

# Urinary tract infection: Patient reproted dysuria, accompanied 
by evidence of a UTI on UA (WBC 66 with few bacteria). Recurrent 
UTIs due to anatomy. She had been on ciprofloxacin 250 mg PO BID 
prior to admission. She was given one dose of nitrofurantoin in 
ED, and then was transitioned back to ciprofloxacin 250 mg PO 
BID. She will continue her previous course of ciprofloxacin 
after discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Systolic CHF: After her NSTEMI in ___, patient had an EF 
that was decreased to 40%. On admission, she had mild edema at 
the ankles, but no other overt signs of volume overload. 
Following her cardiac cath on ___, a repeat TTE showed 
improved EF to > 55%, along with normal global/regional 
biventricular systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation, mild 
mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and mild

Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for leg swelling and shortness 
of breath. We found out that you had a heart failure 
exacerbation. To treat this, we gave you a medicine (Lasix) to 
make you pee and closely monitored your fluid status and your 
labs. Your swelling and breathing improved and your labs showed 
that your heart was recovering. We did an echocardiogram 
(ultrasound of the heart) which showed that there had not been 
any changes since your previous one.

We changed some of your heart failure medications. You should 
review your medication list carefully. You should weigh yourself 
every day and call your doctor if your weight goes up by more 
than 3 lbs. You also need to have labs checked within 1 week

___: Renal U/S:
IMPRESSION:

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with history of HTN, HLD, CAD, dCHF 
(EF 55-60% in ___, Diabetes on insulin, hx of CVA, recently 
diagnosed pericardial effusion, p/w acute-onset altered mental 
status, unsteadiness, urinary incontinence found to also be in 
respiratory distress.

#RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Likely ___ flash pulmonary edema. Patient 
being resuscitated with fluid and was also very hypertensive in 
the ED to 180s systolic. From at___ notes, diuretics were also 
decreased to 20mg which could have predisposed him to having an 
episode of flash pulmonary edema. BNP on arrival was in the 
11000s favoring acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. Patient was 
placed on fluid restriction and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix. 
However patient was also febrile to 101 in the ED and has had hx 
of prior stroke, so there was some concern for aspiration. He 
was therefore covered broadly with vanc/cefepime/flagyl (flagyl 
added given concern for aspiration) but these antibiotics were 
discontinued after a few days given lack of clinical evidence of 
pneumonia. The patient's shortness of breath improved with 
diuresis alone and he never complained of cough, had an elevated 
WBC count, or was febrile after being admitted. An echo was 
performed which compared favorably with his prior echo in ___ 
with no changes in ejection fraction.

#ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. Patient does have hx 
of stroke but CT head was negative for  acute intracranial 
process.  Given urinary incontinence, gait instability, normal 
pressure hydrocephalus is also on differential but no prominence 
of ventricles on CT head. Infectious etiology also on 
differential given fevers in setting of AMS.  Patient could have 
also suffered a seizure given urinary incontinence although no 
prior hx of seizures.  Infectious work up sent off which came 
back negative.  Patient was back to baseline upon arrival to the 
ICU and his mental status was stable and at his baseline 
throughout admission. The most likely etiology of his acute 
mental status decompensation is pulmonary edema and resulting 
respiratory distress.  

#Acute on chronic kidney disease: Patient had an increase from 
his baseline creatinine of 3.3 to 4.1 which trended back down to 
3.7. CKD thought to be due to worsening DM. Most likely etiology 
is pre-renal due to to infection/dehydration. His creatinine was 
trended daily and a renal ultrasound was negative for 
obstruction or hydronephrosis.  

#CHF: Patient has hx of dCHF. Echo on this admission reveals 
preserved EF without new regional wall motion abnormalities when 
compared with that from ___. Fluid restriction to 1.5L and 
2g Na diet were employed with daily weights and strict ins and 
outs recorded. His metoprolol 100 qdaily was increased to 150 
qdaily for improved BP control.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted because you were having 
shortness of breath and fevers. We determined that your 
shortness of breath was likely due to an acute exacerbation of 
your heart failure and haveing too much fluid in your lungs. We 
gave you a medication to help you remove the fluid from your 
lungs. Your kidney function was also slightly worse than usual 
while you were admitted. We closely followed it while you were 
hospitalized and it returned to what is normal for you. We also 
noticed that your blood pressure was somewhat high while you 
were here, so we increased one of your blood pressure 
medications (metoprolol). This is noted on the medication list 
you will be given at discharge.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team

History of Present Illness:
___ F h/o presyncopal episodes the in the last 2 days, 
associated with dyspnea as well as diaphoresis. Patient also 
reports increased shortness of breath on exertion.

Two days prior to admission, the patient was standing in the 
bathroom (no full bladder, not moving bowels) when she 
experienced narrowing of her visual fields, disequilibium (not 
vertiginous without nausea) sudden in onset. This was followed 
by a tightening in the throat, diaphoresis, and heart 
palpaitations. This resolved over the course of ___ minutes 
after she sat down. There was no hearing involvement or loss of 
consciousness. This was witness by her husband, who thought she 
looked pale.

The day prior to admission, she had a second, similar episode 
while standing in the kitchen. This resolved in approximately 15 
minutes. Again, this did not occur after standing from sitting 
nor was there any obvious vagal trigger. She was not exerting 
herself at the time. 

Notably, she is not light-headed when she stands. She has had no 
chest pain whatsoever. She describes one episode of questionable 
DOE recently but has not had more than very mild limitation of 
activity or swelling of the ankles. She denies orthopnea. She 
has no cardiac history. She has no history of anxiety and the 
episodes have not involved any feeling of impending doom/near 
death.

In the ED, initial vs were 97.6 60 192/88 16 98% RA.  Received 
ASA 325, 1L NS, and labs were all unremarkable (CBC, Chem 7, 
troponin-t, CK). EKG as well as initial troponin were negative 
for any acute ischemic disease. Remainder of laboratory work was 
reassuring. Her chest x-ray was normal for any acute 
cardiopulmonary disease. This imaging did reveal a left humeral 
enchondroma.

The patient was high risk according to ___ Syncope Criteria, 
she will be admitted to medicine for further evaluation of 
possible arrhythmia, left ventricular outflow obstruction, ACS, 
or other cardiac etiology. Patient denies any chest pain or 
shortness of breath this time. Hemodynamically stable. Her VS 
prior to admission were 58 156/64 13 98% RA Pain: 0.
 
On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling at her 
baseline. She reported the above history and was hemodynamically 
stable.

Imaging:
Chest PA and Lateral (___)
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No acute chest abnormality. 
2.  Chondroid matrix within the left humeral head likely 
represents a benign entity such as enchondroma.  If there is 
pain referable to this region, this could be better evaluated 
with MRI to exclude a more aggressive chondroid lesion. 

Carotid doppler study:

pre-syncope most consistent with vasovagal. 
 
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Presyncope: Her episodes have some characteristics of 
vasovagal episodes. She describes prodromal symptoms consistent 
with those preceeding a neurocardiogenic/vasovagal episode, 
including diaphoresis, weakness, transient vision loss, and 
increased heart rate. Episodes occurred while patient was 
standing, not with exercise or time of situational or emotional 
stress, again more consistent with a neurocardiogenic etiology. 
They do not sound like orthostasis by history, nor is she 
orthostatic on exam. Given the lack of symptoms during exertion, 
arrhythmia is less likely although her brother does apparently 
have some form of malignant arrhythmia. Seizure and stroke are 
not on the differential. She has no reason to be hypoglycemic, 
although her episodes do sound somewhat reminiscent of transient 
hypoglycemia. 

The patient was observed overnight during which she was 
asymptomatic and no events recorded on telemetry. Her serial 
troponins were negative with no abnormalities seen on EKG. She 
was discharged with ___ of hearts and will follow up with 
cardiology as an outpatient.

INACTIVE ISSUES:
# HTN: continue ASA, HCTZ
# HLD: continue pravastatin
# GERD: continue omeprazole

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# SYNCOPE: Follow up with cardiology with ___ of Hearts monitor
# ENDOCHRONDROMA: Follow up with PCP given the incidental 
finding of enchondroma on radiographic imaging. Consider 
possible MRI as an outpatient

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old gentleman with HIV (last CD4 210, VL
150,000 per patient), followed at ___, restarted on HAART 3
weeks ago, who initially presented with right thigh and knee 
pain
and swelling as well as fevers and is now found to have septic
arthritis of the right knee.

His current series of events began ___ weeks ago when he
was struck twice on the right thigh by a dishcart (he works in a
restaurant). He developed immediate pain afterwards which he
treated by icing it and with ibuprofen. He was seen in the ED 
and
placed in an air cast which he wore for the next 3.5 weeks. The
injury did not break the skin as far as he is aware.

He subsequently developed a large bruise which became
increasingly swollen and painful. He was then seen about 10 days
ago by his PCP and told to stop wearing the air cast. By the 
next
morning the leg had become significantly more swollen. He
developed fevers to 102.8 at home which he felt were likely due
to the pain and thus did not seek further evaluation at that
time. The fevers broke when he iced his knee. His pain continued
to get worse however and he continued to have fevers. He reports
not being able to bend his knee since the initial injury. 

He finally presented to the ED on ___. Imaging in the ED was
suboptimal due to patient pain but showed a massive soft tissue
density in the anterior thigh with a broad differential 
including
hematoma. His knee was aspirated and irrigated with fluid 
showing
WBC of 192,500 with 92% PMNs and 111 RBCs. Labs showed WBC count
10.0, ESR 128, and CRP of 217.9.

Imaging
___ CHEST (PA & LAT): IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with 
central vascular congestion, but without frank edema.

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION:  No acute 
intracranial process.  Small hypodensity in the left centrum 
semiovale may relate to small vessel ischemic change, however, 
given assymetric with the right side, nonurgent brain MRI would 
further evaluate.

___  Cardiovascular ECHO: Poor echo windows. The left 
atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

___ RENAL U.S.: IMPRESSION: 1.  No definite ultrasound 
findings to suggest pyelonephritis, although this diagnosis 
cannot be excluded sonographically.  2.1 cm hypoechoic lesion in 
the
right upper renal pole, poorly visualized and indeterminate; 
this could represent a cyst but in the current clinical setting, 
focal infection or abscess cannot be excluded.  Per the 
patient's report, there has been a recent abdominal CT performed 
at ___ comparison to this study is recommended.  Of 
note, if this study is uploaded into PACS, an addendum could be 
issued at that time.  If this study cannot be obtained, further 
evaluation could be performed with CT. 3.  Right lower pole 15 
mm cyst or calyceal diverticulum.  4.  Possible duplex right 
kidney.  

___ CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO: IMPRESSION: 1.  Large 
rim-enhancing fluid collection along the lower abdominal 
incision site, likely a seroma, is stable to slightly smaller 
since ___. 
Recommended clinical correlation to assess for possible 
superinfection. 2.  No intra-abdominal pathology identified to 
explain the patient's symptoms. 3.  Unexplained massive 
splenomegaly.
4.  Cholelithiasis.

___ CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM: IMPRESSION: 1.  Right PICC at 
the cavoatrial junction. 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with stage IV endometrial cancer on 
anastrazole, DM2, CAD, CKD, chronic respiratory failure with 
hypoxemia on home oxygen, and morbid obesity presents from her 
PCP's office with chest discomfort and possible EKG changes in 
the context of a gastrointestinal illness.
.
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea  
Patient presented following three days of diarrhea, nausea, and 
dry heaving. This was more severe than her chronic diarrhea from 
radiation, and was likely the result of a viral or bacterial 
gastroenteritis. Stool studies and C. diff testing were 
negative, and according to the patient's oncologist, Arimidex 
was not likely causative. Ondansetron was originally given for 
nausea but this was changed to compazine given concern about QTc 
prolongation. The nausea and vomiting resolved over the course 
of the hospital stay, and the diarrhea improved significantly.
. 
# Chest pain  
Patient presented with chest discomfort that occurred in the 
context of dry heaving. Her PCP was concerned about EKG changes 
(septal Q waves and T wave inversions), especially concerning 
given the patient's significant history of CAD, including an MI 
that led to a cardiac catheterization in ___ (occlusion of the 
cardiac vessels was found at that time but patient did not 
tolerate the procedure and no intervention was done). However, 
following admission the patient noted that the discomfort was 
different from the pressure she had felt during her prior MI, 
and repeat EKG was similar to prior baseline (___). Troponins 
were elevated to 0.21 but downtrended. The overall presentation 
was not considered highly concerning for acute coronary 
syndrome, so anticoagulation was avoided given baseline 
thrombocytopenia. Cardiology (Atrius) was consulted and agreed 
that this was likely demand ischemia in the context of 
hypovolemia rather than ACS.
.  
# Fever/GNR bacteremia (E.Coli)
Febrile to 100.4 at ED, and had several further low-grade fevers 
on the floor. UA was positive for nitrites, and given diarrhea, 
GI was considered another possible source of infection. She was 
started on Bactrim on ___, but this was changed to meropenem on 
___ when blood cultures grew gram negative rods. This was 
continued despite final culture results showing pan-sensitive E. 
coli due to concern about cross-reactivity of cephalosporins 
with a penicillin allergy and fluoroquinolones in the context of 
prolonged QTc. ID consulted and determined that it was likely 
safe for her to try ceftriaxone, which she did on ___, and she 
was discharged on this after PICC placement.  Surveillance blood 
cultures were negative.  Renal U/S and CT scan of abd/pelvis 
were obtained, which did not show evidence of abscess.  She did 
have a fluid collection in the abdomen, but this is known from 
prior imaging approximately 1 month ago, and has improved in 
size.  The collection is most likely a seroma.  
.
#Pancytopenia  
Downtrending WBCs (to 1.5), hematocrit, and platelets; she was 
placed on neutropenic precautions. Possibly secondary to 
infection, antibiotics (Bactrim or meropenem), or other 
medication effect. OSH records showed baseline WBCs over past 
few months in 3s following radiation treatment. Although the 
levels did not return to baseline, they stabilized prior to 
discharge, and she will follow up with her outpatient providers.
 .
# Elevated bicarb  
Bicarb elevated to 33 on admission, likely representing a 
metabolic alkalosis due to GI losses from diarrhea. Metabolic 
compensation for a chronic respiratory acidosis may also have 
contributed.  Trended down shortly after admission.
.
# Diabetes  
Patient's home NPH was continued, and she was placed on an 
insulin sliding scale.
.
# Endometrial cancer  
Completed radiation therapy; not a candidate for chemo. Arimidex 
was continued.
.

relief of her pain, however the majority of the benefit wore off 
after several hours. Lidocaine patches were applied with 
excellent relief. She reported a good decrease in her pain where 
she was able to tolerate some touch and the feel of 
clothing/blankets on her skin. She did remain constipated, but 
felt ready for discharge home on ___. Follow-up with the

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient transferred to ICU with worsening hypoxia and afib with 
RVR.

1. Hypoxia:  On admission patient had a new oxygen requirement, 
3L nasal cannula, while at baseline she was on room air.  
Throughout her admission, patient denied shortness of breath but 
did complain of fatigue.  Given her rapid heart rate, the 
patient underwent a CTA to rule out PE.  CTA showed bilateral 
pleural effusions with LLL collapse, but no PE.  Given CTA 
findings her initial presentation was thought to be secondary to 
heart failure, possibly exacerbated by a fib w/ RVR and she was 
diuresed with po lasix.  CTA did show extensive mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy and so infectious vs. malignant etiologies were 
considered.  
.
Over the course of her hospitalization, she required two 
admissions to the MICU.  On ___ she decompensated with 
hypoxia and A-fib with RVR with a question of aspiration event. 
Her a-fib was managed by increasing metoprolol dose and digoxin 
loading/maintenance with good HR (70s-80s) and BP control 
(110-120s).  Given the rise in WBC, she was started and 
completed an 8 day course for HCAP with vanc and zosyn.  She was 
diuresed in the with iv lasix.  A TEE was done that showed 
diastolic dysfunction and BNP was elevated to 10K.  CE were 
trended but were flat.  She was transferred to the floor for 
further management. 
.
On the floor patient improved with diuresis and antibiotic 
course.  Her leukocytosis also downtrended.  Speech and swallow 
consulted who did not see si/sx of aspiration.  However, there 
remained concern that patient was aspirating and she was placed 
on aspiration precautions.  She had another episode of hypoxia 
with afib and RVR requiring NRB; ABG on NRB showed 7.52/36/65/30 
with lactate 4.8.  She was transferred to the MICU a second 
time.  A repeat Chest CT was concerning for right middle lobe 
pneumonia, patient weaned off to nasal cannula and lactate 
trended down.  Patient was diuresed and transferred back to the 
floor.  On ___, patient spiked a fever, and was started on iv 
meropenem and vanc for an 8 day course of aspiration pneumonia, 
and pan-cultured.  She improved with antibiotics and 
defervesced.  Urine and blood culture showed no growth on 
discharge.
.
Patient was managed with chest ___ and aggressive pulmonary 
toilet.  Pulmonology was consulted, who agreed with management 
of antibiotics, diuresis, and BP/rate control.  Given her 
anatomy thoracentesis thought to be unlikely to result in 
re-expansion of her left lung.  Goals of care were discussed 
further with patient.  Patient decided that further MICU 
transfers were not align with her goals of care and decided to 
be DNI.  Patient was discharged to nursing facility with plans 
to transition to hospice care.  Ultimately decision was made 
with family and patient for do not hospitalize as this would not 
be consistent with patient's goals of care.
- Continue iv vanc and meropenem until ___ to complete 8 
day course
- Continue nasal cannula, wean as tolerated
- Patient has decided to be: DNR/DNI/DNH
.
2. Afib with RVR: This may have been precipitated by lung 
etiology given hypoxia.  Blood pressure was initially stable 
though dipped into the low 100s systolic.  She was on Metoprolol 
on admission which was increased to 75mg PO TID.  Patient had 
several episodes of RVR to 160s which were managed with gentle 
bolus, with minimal response, then IV metoprolol and IV dilt.  
She was ruled out for an MI, and infectious work up was 
revealing for pneumonia.  Her coumadin was initially held given 
her history of falls.  This was restarted during her 
hospitalization.  However, as patient remained hypoxic and weak, 
further discussions regarding risk/benefit of coumadin were had 
with patient and son. Ultimately, the immediate risks of bleed 
were thought to outweigh the long-run benefits. Coumadin was 
stopped on discharge.
- Hold metoprolol or diltiazam if SBP<100, HR<60
.
3. Acute Heart Failure: CT scans notable for bilateral pleural 
effusions. A TTE was done that showed EF 55%, RV moderately 
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. CE were 
negative.  She was maintained with lasix, bb, ccb, and digoxin.  
She was transitioned from iv lasix to 40mg PO lasix, to keep net 
even to 500cc net negative.
- Suspect that lasix dose will need to be reduced.  When patient 
stops iv antibiotics please determine new lasix dose by PO 
intake and fluid status.  Consider reducing dose back to home 
dose of 10mg daily.
.
4. Extensive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: This was seen on CTA 
and the differential thought to include infection vs. 
malignancy.  On repeat imaging, there was small improvement in 
lymphadenopathy after diuresis and antibiotic treatment.  
Pulmonology consulted and given goals of care (as stated above), 
further invasive work up was not in line with patient's wishes.  
As stated above she spiked a temp ___ and was pan-cultured and 
started on ___ x8days for aspiration pna.
.
5. Leukocytosis: Seen by hematologist Dr. ___ at ___, 
with leukocytosis in the past in ___.  Throughout her 
admission, WBC ranged from 9 to 30 w/ primarily PMN diff (90s).  
She was treated for pneumonia infection with two course of 
antibiotics which improved her leukocytosis.
.
6. Thrombocytosis: It was confirmed w/ her outpatient 
hematologist that patient has a known JACK2 mutation by PCR.  
She was continued on Hydroxyurea 3 days per week.

Discharge Instructions:
We had the pleasure of taking care of you while you were at the 
___.  You were admitted because you fell and because of 
shortness of breath.  Your shortness of breath was from volume 
overload from your heart failure, lung collapse, and infection.  
We treated you with lasix, antibiotics, and inhalers.  You also 
had a very fast heart rate due to your atrial fibrillation.  We 
increased your metoprolol and started you on a new medication 
called digoxin.  While you were here we did a chest CT that 
showed opacities and enlarged lymph nodes in the lung.  A 
pulmonologist saw you and you agreed that you did not want 
further invasive testing.  You also decided that you did not 
want any ICU tranfers and to change your code status from do not 
resuscitate (DNR) and okay to intubate, to DNR/DNI (do not 
resuscitate and do not intubate). 

We have made the following changes to your medications:
1. We have changed your metoprolol to metoprolol succinate daily 
for your atrial fibrillation
2. We have started you on digoxin for atrial fibrillation
3. We have stopped your cephalexin
4. We have started you on lidocaine patch for pain
5. We have started you on vancomycin and meropenem for 
aspiration pneumonia
6. We have increased your lasix dose to 40mg daily
7. We have stopped your coumadin

If you feel lightheaded or your blood pressure drops, you should 
not take your lasix.

Mr. ___ is a ___ with h/o Marfan Syndrome c/b aortic
aneurysm, ASD and mitral valve regurgitation s/p aortic root
replacement, MVR and ASD repair who p/w worsening dysphagia c/f
achalasia. Briefly, patient reports onset of difficulty fully
swallowing food beginning ___ years ago. Since then, his symptoms
have progressed to significant chest pain with PO intake. He
reports the sensation of food becoming stuck in his chest that 
is
only able to be swallowed after he drinks large volumes of

significant delay in passage of a barium tablet without numerous
sips of water. After thorough GI evaluation, he was diagnosed
with presumed Type 2 achalasia and is now referred to surgical
clinic for operative evaluation.

On further review, the patient reports intermittent chest pain
for which he sometimes presents to the ED for evaluation. He 
most
recently underwent exercise stress test on ___ that was
negative for any signs of myocardial ischemia. He also
intermittently develops profuse epistaxis (not on

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
___ myotomy and partial fundoplication on ___. You 
tolerated the procedure well and are ambulating, tolerating a 
regular diet, and your pain is controlled by pain medications by 
mouth. You are now ready to be discharged to home. Please follow 
the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 
- You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 
otherwise.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone for 
pain control. You may take liquid Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 
to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours

Imaging:
CXR ___
Possible asymmetric right greater than left, pulmonary edema; 
superimposed 
infectious process not excluded. Given history of hemoptysis, 
underlying 
pulmonary hemorrhage is not excluded. Small right pleural 
effusion. 

CXR ___
Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable 
cardiac and 
mediastinal contours. Prosthetic aortic valve. There is interval 
worsening 
of bilateral airspace and interstitial process which may reflect 
pulmonary 
edema, worsening pneumonia, or a progressing hypersensitivity 
reaction.  
Pulmonary hemorrhage could also have this appearance. Clinical 
correlation is advised. No pneumothorax. No acute pulmonary 
abnormality appreciated. 

TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is borderline low (LVEF 50%). A bioprosthetic aortic 
valve prosthesis is well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion 
and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate 
(___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
borderline low left ventricular systolic function. Well-seated 
bioprosthetic aortic valve with normal transvalvular gradients. 
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
left ventricular function appears less vigorous. The gradients 
across the bioprosthetic aortic valve are normal.  

CXR ___
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there are 
unchanged 
bilateral airspace opacities and a small right pleural effusion. 
The 
opacities and the effusion have not changed in the interval. 
Moderate 
cardiomegaly, status post CABG with subsequent position of the 
surgical 
material. No other relevant findings. 

CXR ___
IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in diffuse pulmonary opacities, 
suggesting 
decrease in edema, with probable superimposed pneumonia. 

CT Chest ___
FINDINGS: There is mild, apical-predominant centrilobular and 
paraseptal 
emphysema. Diffuse ground-glass opacities are present throughout 
both lungs, involving all lobes and extending to the pleural 
surfaces. Early fibrosis with mild honeycombing at the lung 
bases. Mild diffuse peribronchial wall thickening, but no 
interstitial thickening. No pleural effusions.  Heart is normal 
in size, without pericardial effusion. Changes of coronary 
artery bypass grafting, with mediastinal clips. Note is made of 
a prosthetic aortic valve and discarded right atrial/ventricular 
pacemaker leads. Diffuse calcific atherosclerosis is present in 
the thoracic aorta.  Prominent mediastinal nodes measure up to 
12 mm in short axis in the superior right paratracheal region, 
10 mm in the inferior right paratracheal region, and 13 mm in 
the subcarinal region. Changes of median sternotomy, with 
multiple chronically fractured and malpositioned sternal wires. 
No sternal fluid collections or osseous abnormalities. 
Examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but 
reveals a 
nasogastric tube in appropriate position. Gastric diverticulum 
arises from 
the greater curvature. Cholecystectomy changes. Accesorry 
splenule is 
present. Multiple colonic diverticula, without acute 
inflammation.  
IMPRESSION: Diffuse ground-glass pulmonary opacities and early 
fibrosis.  
Given patient history, this may represent acute-on-chronic 
organizing 
pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonitis, less likely fibrosis 
with 
superimposed infection.

___ CXR
REPORT: Status post sternotomy. NG tube courses throughout the 
mediastinum to its expected location in the stomach. The ET tube 
is in good position, lying about 4 cm above the carina. 
There is a right-sided internal jugular line in unchanged 
position. There is symmetrical blunting of both costophrenic 
sulci. Generalized increased lung markings consistent most with 
fluid overload are grossly unchanged. 
More confluent abnormalities in the left lung base in particular 
are also 
unchanged. I note also CT from ___ suggesting this and 
in fact very little fluid overload, so presumptively the changes 
represent the ongoing alveolitis-type changes identified on that 
radiograph. 
.
___ CXR
FINDINGS: Bilateral diffuse lung opacities are presisting. On 
concurrent 
review with prior chest CT dated ___, these opacities 
represent a 
combination of ground-glass opacities and consolidation and 
bibasilar 
fibrosis, unchanged since ___, but improved since ___. All these changes are more on the right side and may 
represent continuing 
alveolitis. As appreciated on recent chest CT, there was no 
component of 
pulmonary edema then nor in today's radiograph. Mild widening of 
the 
mediastinum is from increased mediastinal fat in conjunction 
with multiple 
lymph nodes as appreciated on the chest CT. There is evidence of 
prior median sternotomy and sternal sutures are intact. 
Effusions, if any, are small bilaterally and unchanged. There is 
no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.  
Hilar contours are unremarkable. Aorta has a mild tortuous 
course and 
demonstrates mild-to-moderate and severe atherosclerotic 
calcification. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with COPD, CAD, CHF and Afib presenting with cough, dyspnea 
and hemoptysis admitted with PNA and pulmonary edema.

# Dyspnea and Sepsis: Patient likely had bacterial pneumonia 
that followed a viral URI several weeks ago. On admission, felt 
to have pulmonary edema and pneumonia, treated for both with 
ceftriaxone/azithromycin and diuresis.  After 7L diuresis, 
patient had no improvement.  On ___ he was noted to have 
increasing respiratory distress and was electively intubated.  
Following intubation he became hypotensive and required pressor 
support during ___ and ___.  Cardiac Catheterization showed 
wedge of 14 with V wave of 80. CT Chest revealed ground-glass 
opacities consistent with acute-on-chronic organizing pneumonia 
or acute interstitial pneumonitis.  Was treated with high dose 
steroids with apparent initial improvement and was extubated.  
His mental status was very altered after extubation requiring 
olanazpine with mild effect.  He had a respiratory 
decompensation after several days of extubation requiring 
reintubation.  Abx were broadened to vanco/zosyn and he was 
started on solumedrol 1gm IV for 3 days for concern for 
undertreated COP, as his infectious work-up to date had not been 
revealing and his extensive work-up for cardiac causes of his 
dyspnea and respiratory failure was negative. As such, given the 
lack of an alternative diagnosis and the suspicion that COP may 
be the cause of his respiratory failure, aggressive 
glucocorticoid treatment was pursued in an effort to give him 
every chance to survive his acute illness. After three days of 
treatment with pulse-dose Solumedrol, however, there was no 
meaningful improvement in his respiratory status and his overall 
clinical status was progressively worsening with progressive 
acute renal failure, falling platelets, and worsening mental 
status (decreasing responsiveness despite holding sedative.) To 
objectively assess his pulmonary response to steroids, we 
obtained a repeat CT scan after completing three days of pulse 
dose steroids which did not show improvement. Given this, and 
given overall status of resp failure, renal failure, altered 
mental status - several meetings were held with the patient's 
son ___ (the patient's HCP) and decision was made to move to 
___.  Terminally extubated and passed away on ___ with son at 
bedside.
.
# AMS - ICU delirium compounded by high steroid dose.  Managed 
with olanzapine with mild effect. His mental status deteriorated 
to the point that he was essentially non-responsive, including 
several absent brinstem reflexed (no corneal reflex, no cough, 
no gag, minimal pupillary response) prior to his being 
transitioned to ___ care. 
.
# Anuric renal failure - Patient was noted to have increasing 
Creatinine after reintubation that was concerning for ATN due to 
an episode of hypotension and hypoperfusion.  His creatinine 
continued to rise and he developed anuric renal failure over the 
last day of his ICU stay. 
.
# Afib w/ RVR: Patient had a HR in the 140s at ___ and received 
10mg IV and 30mg PO diltiazem at ___ ED. His HR was controlled 
to 100-120 by arrival to the ICU.  His home metoprolol was 
initially resumed, stopped ___ given hypotension.  Digoxin was 
started ___ for rhythm control.

IMAGING
=======
IMPRESSION: 
Left lower lobe opacity may reflect pneumonia.  Comparing with 
prior
radiograph would be helpful to determine progression or 
improvement.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with history of dementia, hypertension, 
and diabetes presenting with lethargy found to have LLL PNA 
complicated by hyperglycemia.

# Community Acquired Left Lower Lobe Pneumonia: Patient was 
initially treated as an outpatient with azithromycin for 
suspected pneumonia, however, hyperglycemia ensued in the 
setting of pneumonia leading to admission to ___ (patient 
lives in a memory unit at ___ on ___ and they were 
concerned regarding his hyperglycemia). CXR at ___ confirmed 
left lower lobe pneumonia. He initially was started on 
levofloxacin and was subsequently transitioned to ceftriaxone 
and azithromycin. On admission, required supplemental O2 (up to 
3L) but was quickly weaned back to room air. He was asymptomatic 
with normal saturation on room air for 3 days at the time of 
discharge, at which point he had taken 6 days of antibiotics and 
the decision was made to end his course.

# Type II Diabetes Mellitus Complicated by Hyperglycemia: At 
Memory unit at ___ on the ___ patient had blood sugars 
in the high 300s. Given concern for the hyperglycemia, was 
transferred to ___ for evaluation. As noted above, etiology of 
the hyperglycemia was in the setting of pneumonia. At his 
facility he is on metformin 1000 mg PO BID and glipizide 2.5 mg 
PO daily. Initially, these were held and he was continued 
insulin sliding scale. He resumed his home glipizide and 
metformin. He remained hyperglycemia, so sitagliptin was added 
and metformin and glipizide were increased. He continued to 
require sliding scale insulin at discharge.

During hospitalization, his hemoglobin A1C was noted to be 8.0%. 


As insulin administration in the Memory Unit at his facility is 
somewhat complicated, an attempt was made to develop an oral 
diabetes regimen. ___ Diabetes was consulted for further 
recommendations. They recommended the above regimen with a plan 
to increase his oral agents and try to wean off the sliding 
scale. If he is unable, the ___ clinic can change him to a 
basal bolus insulin regimen and rehab providers and family can 
determine how this will impact his living situation.

# Hypertension: Continued lisinopril 30 mg PO daily.

# Dementia: Alert and oriented x 1 at baseline. Continued 
meantime 5 mg PO BID. His home ___ was not on formulary at 
the hospital. He was discharged on memantine 5 mg PO BID and 
galantine 16 mg PO daily. 

TRANSITIOANL ISSUES
=================
Transitional Issues:
- needs vitamin D checked as an outpatient
- ___ follow up
- Patient was persistently hyperglycemic on metformin, 
glipizide, Januvia. Insulin sliding scale was added to the 
regimen. We recommend gradually increasing his glipizide and 
tapering down his sliding scale to get him off insulin and 
hopefully transition back to the memory unit. If he is unable to 
come off the insulin, the ___ clinic can transition him to a 
basal/bolus insulin regimen at his follow up appointment and if 
this is a barrier to returning to the memory unit, his long term 
residential situation will need to be re-addressed with family.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after 
you were noted to have elevated blood sugars. You were also 
noted to have a pneumonia. The reason for the elevated blood 
sugars was likely secondary to the underlying pneumonia. 

You initially required oxygen but after receiving intravenous 
antibiotics, you were able to breath comfortably on room air. 

in order to better control your blood sugars and optimize you on 
an oral medication regimen to control your blood sugars, you 
were seen by the Diabetes specialists at ___. They 
recommended continuing with metformin, glipizide and 
sitagliptin. You will remain on sliding scale insulin for now. 
This will be stopped if recovery from your illness or increased 
doses of your oral medications will allow. 

Best Wishes,
Your ___ Care Team

 IntervalsAxes
___
___

ADMISSION CXR:
___ male patient with left lower extremity ischemia,
scheduled for angio but presenting with pneumonia.  Evaluate for 
interval
change. 
Patient's condition required examination in sitting position 
using AP frontal
and left lateral views.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement, 
predominantly
involving the left heart.  The thoracic aorta is of ordinary 
dimension but
demonstrates advanced walled calcifications both in the aortic 
arch as well as
in the entire ascending aorta.  Aortic valve calcifications are 
suspected on
the lateral view.  There exists a diffuse haze over the entire 
left-sided
hemithorax and thickening of the left-sided pleural space is 
noted along the
left lateral chest wall.  There exists some crowded vasculature 
in the left
lower lobe area in retrocardiac position possibly suggesting 
some atelectasis
but acute discrete parenchymal infiltrates identifying a 
pneumonia cannot be
seen.  The right hemithorax is better penetrated and there is no 
evidence of
pleural thickenings on that side.  Also, the lateral pleural 
sinuses are free,
thus no evidence of acute pleural effusion is present.  
Accessible areas of
the pulmonary vasculature do not demonstrate any advanced CHF or 
pulmonary
edema.  Our records do not include a previous chest examination, 
thus there is
no possibility to comment on interval changes

FOLLOW UP CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
extubated.  The signs previously indicative of pulmonary edema 
have
substantially decreased.  However, there still is a 
mild-to-moderate left
pleural effusion with subsequent retrocardiac atelectasis.  
Moderate
cardiomegaly.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This ___ y/o M was transferred from ___ with a 
chief complaint of L foot pain which he has had for about ___ 
year. He was brought to ___ to have an angiogram/plasty with 
Dr. ___. Upon presentation to us patient was currently on 
antibiotics for treatment of pneumonia. He stated his foot was 
painful, specifically his left hallux. It was decided to change 
his oral antibiotics (Levaquin) to IV antibiotics and wait for 
his pneumonia to resolve before taking the patient for Angio. 

On hospital night 1 patient arrested presumably due to a 
pulmonary embolism. He was successfully resuscitated and 
transferred to the CVICU intubated on vasopressors and NO. A 
heparin gtt was empirically started given dilated RV as seen on 
bedside
echo. it was also noted that he was no longer producing any 
urine.

On hospital day 2 the patient was extubated and had oxygen sats 
of 94% with 50% mask. All pressors were stopped and his kidney 
function began to return (UO was between ___ cc/hr). A renal 
consult was called. 

Patient was transferred from the Vascular Surgery service to the 
medical service, given his complicated course, and the decision 
that he would hold off on any vascular decision.  

Prior to admission to the internal medicine service late on the 
evening of ___, pt was noted to be bleeding from a pulled 
IV site with substantial amount of blood pooled beneath is arm. 
A stat hematocrit was performed prior to transfer which was 
stable. His VS were stable. Once patient arrived to the medicine 
floor, he was monitored on telemetry given his recent PEA 
arrest. He was continued on IV antibiotics for his previously 
diagnosed pneumonia, although it was noted he had no pneumonia 
on his current CXR. He was continued on IV heparin gtt for 
presumed PE on a tighter therapeutic range given his recent 
bleeding, with plans to repeat a formal TTE in the morning and 
pursue further workup of his PEA arrest. Of note, the patient's 
spouse had a lengthy discussion with the on call ___ 
resident and it was determined that the patient would continue 
to have a DNR code status (intubation acceptable). 

Once on the floor, a repeat hematocrit was to be drawn given his 
recent bleeding. However, this could not be drawn given 
patient's confusion and agitation which was acute in nature. He 
was given a dose of zyprexa for agitation and shortly thereafter 
was noted to convert to asystole on the tele monitor. The 
nightfloat intern was called to pronounce the patient. The death 
note is copied below:

(biopsy)
Erythema and petechiae in the whole stomach compatible with mild 
gastritis (biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy)

Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum

EGD/ COLONOSCOPY PATHOLOGY REPORT:
1. Mid esophagus:
- Active esophagitis with numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes 
and scattered eosinophils and
neutophils.
- GMS stain for fungal organisms is negative with satisfactory 
control.
2.. Gastric/stomach:
- Corpus/antral mucosa with mild chronic inactive gastritis.
- Immunostain for Helicobacter species is in progress and the 
results will be reported in a revised
report.
3. Duodenum:
- Duodenal mucosa, within normal limits.
4. Terminal ileum:
- Small intestinal mucosa, within normal limits.
5. Random colon:

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HIV/AIDS with poor medication compliance(CD4 24(3%), 
HIV VL 70K ___, depression, and hx of seizures, who was 
recently admitted with fever, non-bloody diarrhea, and ___ 
(___), who now re-presets with similar symptoms.  

# Fevers/ Diarrhea: Most likely secondary to CMV given she had a 
positive CMV viral load to >900. Given her low CD4 status, 
differential was broad and included other opportunistic 
infections as well as non-opportunistic infections.  Less likely 
to be ischemic or inflammatory. ___ with evidence of 
esophagitis with concern for contribution from ?___ as well 
as some mild colitis in left colon, biopsies taken, revealing 
evidence of CMV in the esophagus, however, no evidence of CMV in 
the colon. She was started on IV  gancyclovir and transitioned 
to PO valgancyclovir, to complete a ___ week course, to be 
determined by outpatient ID. Also started a 14 day course of 
fluconazole, for ___ esophagitis. Ophthalmology was 
consulted, and patient was without evidence of CMV retinitis. 
All other workup, including stool studies, clultures and serum 
cryptococcal antigen were negative. Her diarrhea and fevers 
resolved and her diet was advanced without issues. Of note, 
discontinued empiric CTX/flagyl that were initially started in 
the ED given low concern for bacterial infection. All of the 
above was done in consultation with the infectious disease 
service.  
 
# Fevers: As above unifying diagnosis would be infectious 
colitis possibly from an opportunistic infection as described 
above. However given her AIDS and CMV viremia, fever could also 
represent other systemic infection. CXR without any 
consolidations. The patient did not appear septic. Infectious 
workup results detailed above. Discharged on valgancyclovir and 
fluconazole as above.  

# ___: Baseline Cr 1 which was elevated to 1.5 on admission. 
Most likely pre-renal vs ATN in the setting of diarrhea and poor 
po intake, however, given that she has remained in the 1.4 to 
1.5 range on a subacute time period, this may represent a new 
baseline. Renally dosed all medications, with changes made to 
include HIV meds that were less nephrotoxic. Avoided NSAIDS, 
contrast and other nephrotoxic meds as much as possible. 
Discharge creatinine was 1.4. 

# HIV AIDS: History of med non-complaince however currently 
reports taking her HIV meds. Cannot use Stribild given ___ For 
HIV: Discontinued Stribild. Continued with dolutegravir 50mg 
daily, darunavir 800mg PO daily, cobicistat 100mg daily, 
lamivudine 150mg PO daily per ID recs. Darunavir and cobicistat 
were prescribed as a combination pill at time of discharge. Of 
note, she does have a history of non-adherence to HAART; in the 
setting of depression she states she became tired of taking the 
medications and self-discontinued them. Her mother and brother 
are unaware of her diagnosis; sister is aware and per pt, 
provides support.   

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***
- history of poor adherence to HAART
- Patient should have at least yearly dilated eye exams, sooner
if any issues and this was discussed with the patient. She can
follow up at ___ or by an outside ophthalmologist.
- to complete 14 day course of PO fluconazole, end date 
___.
- to complete ___ week course of valgancyclovir (exact course to 
be determined by outpatient ID physician) (trsnaitioned to PO on 
___.
- patient with anemia, and borderline low B12, should have MMA 
checked as an outpatient (likely effect of HAART therapy).

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma was admitted to 
the HPB Surgical Service on ___ for elective operation. On 
___, the patient underwent pylorus-preserving 
pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) and open cholecystectomy, 
intraoperative patient spiked a fever and was continued on Zosyn 
for empiric coverage post operative, bile and blood cultures 
were sent (please see the Operative Note for details). After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the 
floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter 
and a JP drain x 2 in place, and epidural catheter for pain 
control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.
The ___ hospital course was uneventful and followed the 
Whipple Clinical Pathway without major deviations. 
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with epidural 
analgesia, which was converted to oral pain medication when 
tolerating clear liquids. The NG tube was discontinued on POD# 
2, and the foley catheter discontinued at midnight of POD# 4. 
The patient subsequently voided without problem. The patient was 
started on sips of clears on POD# 3, which was progressively 
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet by POD# 6.  JP amylase 
was sent in the evening of  POD#6; the posterior JP was 
discontinued on POD# 6, and anterior JP was discontinued on POD 
7 as the output and amylase level were low. Patient was 
transitioned from Zosyn to PO Cipro on POD 4 to complete 7 days 
total. Patient remained afebrile with WBC within normal limits 
prior to discharge. 
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and 
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive 
spirrometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The 
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were 
used during this stay. He was transitioned to ___ Lovenox prior 
to discharge. The patient's blood sugar was monitored regularly 
throughout the stay; no insulin was required on discharge. 
At the time of discharge on ___, the patient was doing well, 
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a 
regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain 
was well controlled. The patient was discharged home without 
services. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

History of Present Illness:
___ year-old man presented to ___ for his fourth ___ visit for a 
strange constellation of symptoms including a strange feeling 
like water in his stomach, abdominal pain, a feeling of fecal 
urgency, and warm tingling up into his chest and down his leg.  
He reported a total duration of about three weeks for these 
symptoms.  His most dramatic symptom had been a strange 
sensation of hot and cold.  He reported he would have a very 
cold feeling in his abdomen associated with some pain that was 
most intense in the right upper quadrant.  This would be 
followed by a warm, dry feeling in his chest.  He reported after 
these symptoms he would have a feeling of fecal urgency and 
almost invariably have a bowel movement.   Additionally, 
associated with these episodes he endorsed shortness of breath, 
mild chest pain, diaphoresis, and a presyncopal feeling.  He 
acknowledged these symptoms would lead to a great deal of 
anxiety, which would make him feel worse, but was very insistent 
the anxiety developed after and in response to the symptoms.  He 
denied actually syncope.  He did report various areas of 
paresthesia as part of these spells in a band down his arm or 
leg.  These symptoms led to at least three previous ___ 
evaluations and he had a CT Abdomen (reportedly benign), 
multiple ECG's and multiple sets of labs with attempts to 
empirically treat for PNA, asthma flare, and influenza.  There 
had been some discussion of sending urine metanephrines and both 
his PCP and an ___ physician at ___ recommended this but it was 
deferred as he was completing a steroid course.  He reported 
none of these symptoms had improved with any of the measures 
recommended at other hospitals and he continued to be very 
worried something dangerous was occurring.  Over the last three 
days preceding his presentation these symptoms had been more 
marked and he had a chronic sensation of discomfort in his 
abdomen.  When he awoke on the morning of presentation he had a 
right frontal headache as well as his other symptoms so he 
called ___ and the physician on call, Dr ___ him to 
the ___ for further work up.   

In the ___ VS 99. 100 132/87 18 100%.  Physical exam was notable 
for wheezing so he received albuterol inhaler.  He also received 
buprenorphine-naloxone ___.  He had a benign head CT and was 
admitted to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with history of anxiety, substance 
abuse, and asthma presenting with three weeks of strange 
symptoms and multiple ___ evals.

1) Chills/ Warm Sensation/ Paresthesias/ Paresthesias/ 
Presyncope: The patient presented for at least his fourth visit 
for a complicated set of somatic symptoms including feeling hot 
or cold, migrating paresthesias, fecal urgency, and presyncope.  
 His febrile symptoms are, of course, concerning for infection 
and his neurological symptoms and fever raise concern for 
neurogenic or cardiogenic syncope vs seizure.  The patient was 
monitored >24 hours and had multiple episodes of this symptom 
complex.  Vital signs were checked numerous times and he was 
monitored on telemetry.  There were no episodes of concerning 
arrhythmia, hemodynamic instability, fevers, chills, or other 
appreciable physical exam finding with the exception of the 
patient being somewhat diaphoretic and having some mild, diffuse 
tenderness to palpation on his abdomen.  A wide range of labs 
were checked and no significant abnormalities were detected.  
Ultimate diagnosis remains unclear though the team has 
considerable suspicion of anxiety or atypical panic attacks 
given the patient's marked anxiety and the lack of physical 
findings.  Other possible etiologies would be vasovagal (near) 
syncope perhaps initiated by a viral syndrome that caused loose 
stools and nausea (though neither of these GI symptoms were 
reported during this hospitalization).  His CT head was benign 
and pretest probability of stroke or severe intracranial process 
with NO hard neurological deficits on exam in this young, 
healthy man would be very low.   Other much less likely 
diagnostic possibilities would be pheochromocytoma or carcinoid, 
both of which can cause flushing spells (carcinoid would better 
explain fecal urgency) though one would expect at least some 
vital sign abnormalities during the episodes.  Ultimately, the 
very benign nature of the tests and data from monitoring were 
discussed with the patient and Dr ___ at ___ 
___.  Given the difficulties with initiating 24 hour 
urine monitoring and sending send-out tests in an ultimately 
VERY stable looking man tests of 5-HIAA and urine metanephrines 
were deferred.  We explained to the patient that though we were 
unable to give a specific diagnosis findings were suggestive of 
something not immediately dangerous, which he found reassuring.  
The patient was discharged to follow up with his PCP for further 
___ of these symptoms.  

2) Wheezing/ SOB: Patient has history of asthma and was wheezing 
on presentation.  He was given albuterol inhaler in house.  

3) History of substance abuse: He was continued on his home 
buprenorphine-naloxone.

He tolerated a full diet.  He received subcutaneous heparin for 
DVT prophylaxis.  He was full code.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted due to concerns about the symptoms you have 
been having including sensation of hot and cold, urgency to go 
to the bathroom, abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath, and 
feeling as if you might pass out.  You were admitted and  
monitored overnight.  You have had no vital sign abnormalities, 
dangerous cardiac rhythms, and your labs were unremarkable.  A 
CT scan showed no major intracranial process.  It is unclear 
what is causing your symptoms.  Most likely you had a viral 
syndrome that exacerbated your asthma and perhaps is causing 
something called vasovagal episodes, during which you may feel 
lightheaded.  There are a few other rare illnesses that could 
cause some of these symptoms but these require 24 hour urine 
corrections and take some time to return.  These were deferred 
as an inpatient but will be pursued as an outpatient by your 
PCP.  

Your medications have not been changed.  Please continue to take 
your Suboxone as prescribed.

empiric Cipro/Flagyl, and she tolerated clears. Her pain 
improved with Tylenol and oxycodone x1. As she was tolerating 
clears and PO meds and her diarrhea was improving, she was 
discharged home with strong recommendations to followup in 
Healthcare Associates within the week. She will be contacted if 
the stool cultures return positive and indicate a change in 
therapy. her her symptoms do not improve with a 7-day course of

Abdominal Ultrasound ___:
There is normal echogenicity of the liver. There is no extra- or 

intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. There are two hyperechoic 
lesions in the liver with no convincing vascularity, one 
measuring 1.8 x 2.1 x 2 cm and second one measuring 8 x 8 x ___ile duct measures 3 mm. The portal vein is 
patent. The left kidney measures 10.2 cm. There is a 5-mm 
nonobstructing stone in the upper pole of the left kidney. The 
right kidney measures 10 cm. There is no evidence of 
hydronephrosis. There is no free fluid. The spleen is normal 
measuring 7.3 cm. Evaluation of pancreas is slightly suboptimal 
due to overlapping bowel gas; however, no gross abnormality of 
the pancreatic head. Urinary bladder appears within normal 
limits.   
IMPRESSION: 
1. Two hyperechoic liver lesions in the right liver lobe, with 
no convincing vascularity, with imaging characteristics most 
suggestive of liver hemangioma. 
2. 5-mm nonobstructive stone in the upper pole of the left 
kidney. No 
hydronephrosis. 
3. Patent main portal vein. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with a history of kidney stones who 
presents with a one week history of right sided crampy abdominal 
pain, found to have a left-sided kidney stone and liver cyst on 
abdominal ultrasound.  

.  
# Abdominal Pain: No clear etiology, but felt to be most likely 
related to passage of a kidney stone on the right.  The patient 
described a crampy abdominal pain located on the right, and had 
right and left CVA tenderness on examination.  She was started 
on tamsulosin given the presence of a 5mm stone on that side.  
However, she experienced dizziness, so this medication was 
stopped.  Additionally, the patient mentioned experiencing a 
painful big toe during a prior episode of passing a kidney 
stone. While she did not pass a stone that could be collected 
for laboratory evaluation, the possibility of hyperuricemia and 
concurrent gout was considered, and the patient was given 
information regarding a low uric acid diet.  Her pain resolved 
spontaneously during the admission, and she was able to tolerate 
a regular diet at discharge.  She was instructed to contact her 
PCP regarding further workup for her kidney stones.
.  
# Liver lesions: Outpatient CT records were obtained, which 
noted growth of a liver lesion ___ 7 mm to 17 mm since ___. 
The report did not specify whether this lesion was consistent 
with a cyst or hemangioma, and suggested MRI for further 
characterization.  An ultrasound during admission identified 
cysts consistent with hemangiomas.  This lesion was felt to be 
unrelated to her current episode of abdominal pain.  The patient 
preferred to undergo MRI as an outpatient, and was instructed to 
contact her PCP regarding scheduling this test on discharge.
.
# Migraine HA: The patient reported a history of migraine 
headaches, for which she had taken fioricet in the past, 
although this had been discontinued by her PCP for unknown 
reasons.  While admitted, she did experience a migraine that was 
partially relieved with acetaminophen and tramadol.  She 
requested a trial of motrin for headaches, and was discharged 
with a prescription for several doses of Motrin 800 mg.  She was 
instructed to discuss this medication further with her PCP if 
effective and she would like to continue.
.
# Asthma: The patient denied any asthmatic symptoms, and was 
continued on her home dose of flovent and albuterol prn.

NCHCT: Hypodensity in the right temporoparietal lobe corresponds 
to the areas of restricted diffusion on the patients recent MRI, 
consistent with patients known infarction. 
  
CTA: No definite vascular abnormalities identified in the region 
of the known infarction in the right temporoparietal region. No 
aneurysms identified. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No left atrial mass/thrombus 
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). There 
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
Diastolic function could not be assessed. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is an ___ yo woman with PMH significant for Alzheimer 
dementia, HTN, HLD, and hypothyroidism who presented with left 
sided neglect with acute right temporoparietal infarct. 

# Right temporoparietal infarct: Patient presented with left 
sided neglect and possible left sided field cut. She was placed 
on aspirin 325mg and atorvastatin 40mg and MRI confirmed acute 
infarction involving the right parietotemporal 
region, with associated small internal microhemorrhages. CTA was 
unremarkable. She was monitored on telemetry but there were no 
episodes of atrial fibrillation to account for stroke. HbA1C and 
lipid panel were within normal limits. TTE did not show any 
evidence of left atrial thrombus or PFO. Given her age and 
mental status, it was decided not to pursue long term cardiac 
monitoring for evaluation of atrial fibrillation. Patient had 
difficulty tolerating telemetry monitors while hospitalized and 
it would not change management as the team decided they would 
not start anti-coagulation in this patient even if atrial 
fibrillation was found. She will continue on aspirin as an 
outpatient and follow-up with stroke neurology as ab outpatient. 
  

# UTI: Patient was found to have a UTI on admission and treated 
with 3 days of Ciprofloxacin HCl 250 mg PO/NG Q12H.  

# Hypothyroidism: She was continued on Levothyroxine Sodium 75 
mcg PO/NG DAILY. 

# HTN: She was continued on Lisinopril 5 mg PO/NG DAILY.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old woman with a history of HTN who presents with one 
week of chest pain.  She describes the chest pain as a constant, 
___, left-sided burning sensation that radiates to the back. 
Pain has been progressively worsening over the week. It is worst 
in the mornings, when pain is associated with weakness and 
fatigue.  It is also worse when she exerts her left arm (e.g. 
cutting vegtables), but not with generalized exertion.  She 
states current pain is distinct from heartburn symptoms which 
she had experienced in the past.  Associated symptoms include 
general weakness, fatigue, and mild DOE throughout the week. She 
denies nausea, or diaphoresis.  No fevers, sweats or rigors but 
did have some chills today.  
.
She went to see her PCP today due to her ongoing symptoms.  At 
the PCP's office SL NG was administered with almost immediate 
relief within seconds. She also recieved Aspirin 325mg. She was 
referred to the ED for further workup.  
.  
Of note:  Patient has prior history of admission to ___ ___ years 
ago with chest pain similar to current pain. At the time, pain 
developed acutely while was shoveling snow and was stronger than 
current complaints but similar in distribution and quality. She 
says she spent several days in the hospital and was told her 
heart was ""damaged"". No PTCA was done. She says she had a second 
admission to ___ ___ years ago for difficult to control HTN.  She 
takes her BP meds regularly.
. 
In the ED, initial Vitals: 99.2 66 185/88 18 99% 2L.  Labs were 
notable for absence of leukocytosis and Hct 33.  The patient was 
ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes x 2 and EKG.  The patient 
underwent CXR that showed left basilar atelectasis versus 
infiltrate.  CTA chest ruled out aortic dissection and 
demonstrated extensive bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe 
and bilateral lower lobes.  Levoquin was administered prior to 
admission for possible infiltrate.  Prior to transfer, VS: 97.8, 
180/70, 57, 17, 98% ra.   
.  
On the floor, patient feels well.  She states her pain had 
resolved completley after NG at ___'s office. She has no further 
complaints.  She denies any recent or past known aspiration 
events. She had no recent travel, no sick or animal exposures 
and denies any history of TB or industrial exposures.

. 
CXR ___:  
Findings: PA and lateral view of the chest, no prior. There is 
subtle left 
basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis, however, infiltrate is 
not excluded. In addition, there is a 7-mm nodular opacity 
projecting in the suprahilar region on the left. Elsewhere, the 
lungs are grossly clear, costophrenic angles are sharp. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous 
and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis versus infiltrate. Possible 
left 
suprahilar nodule. These findings can be followed up on the 
upcoming chest 
CT, which has been ordered. 
. 
CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis ___:  
1. No evidence of aortic dissection. 
2. Bilateral adrenal nodules measuring 10 mm on the left and 8 
mm on the 
right, incompletely characterized on this single phase study. 
Further 
evaluation could be performed with an adrenal protocol CT or MR. 

3. Extensive bronchiectasis with associated reticulation and 
ground glass 
opacity in the basilar aspects of the right middle lobe and both 
lower lobes, possibly secondary to chronic aspiration or prior 
infection, although an intrinsic lung process, such as 
non-specific interstitial fibrosis, cannot be excluded. 
4. Right renal simple cyst. Additional left renal tiny 
hypodensities are too small to characterize, but are 
statistically simple cysts. 
5. Small quantity of free fluid in the dependent portion of the 
pelvis is a nonspecific finding, but not typically seen in a 
female patient of this age. 
6. Moderate lumbar spinal stenosis at L3-L4 and L4-L5. 
. 
Cardiac Perfusion Persantine ___:  
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast 
attenuation. There is activity adjacent to the heart in the 
stress images. 
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.  Rest and stress 
perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the 
left ventricular myocardium.  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  The calculated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 57% with an EDV of 102 ml. 
. 
Stress Portion ___:  No anginal type symptoms or ischemic ECG 
changes. 
. 
MRI head ___:  
1. There is no evidence of acute or subacute intracranial 
pathology. 
2. A few foci of high signal intensity are identified in the 
subcortical 
white matter of the right frontal region, which are nonspecific 
and may 
represent chronic microvascular ischemic changes. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with a history of HTN admitted with 1 week of 
chest pain, hospitalization complicated by dizziness.  
.  
# Chest pain: Patient presented to the emergency department with 
a week of left-sided stabbing, burning chest pain that radiates 
to the back.  In the emergency department, she was ruled out for 
myocardial infarction by enzymes and EKG.  She underwent CTA 
chest/abdomen/pelvis, that did not show evidence of pulmonary 
embolism or aortic dissection.  Stress test was performed given 
the patient's risk factors that showed normal myocardial 
perfusion and function, and absence of cardiac symptoms with 
stress.  CT did show extensive bronchiectasis and ground glass 
opacities, likely representing ___ syndrome in the 
context of the patient's chest pain, associated with fatigue and 
malaise.  Given absence of fevers and cough, there is no 
indication for antibiotic therapy.  The patient should undergo 
follow-up CT in 3 months to evaluate for evolving ground glass 
opacities.   
.  
# Dizziness: During admission, patient endorsed 2 weeks of 
dizziness that occurred with sudden onset.  She had no focal 
neurologic deficits on exam.  MRI brain did not show evidence of 
an acute cerebral process.  Orthostatics were negative and the 
patient was not bradycardic.  However, given the patient's 
description of symptoms and borderline-low blood pressure, 
labetalol was decreased to 200 mg BID.  The patient was seen by 
physical therapy, and was found to be safe to discharge home.  
.  
# Bilateral adrenal nodules: Incidental finding on CT. ___ be of 
concern given history of difficult-to-control hypertension.  The 
patient will need dedicated adrenal imaging as an outpatient.  
___ consider functional adrenal studies to evaluate for cause of 
poorly-controlled hypertension.  
.  
# normocytic anemia: Patient admitted with mild normocytic 
anemia without known baseline.  Anemia remained stable 
throughout admission.  No evidence of bleed.  The patient should 
follow up with her primary care physician regarding her anemia.  

.
# HTN: chronic.  The patient was normotensive to mildly 
hypotensive during admission on home regimen of lisinopril and 
labetalol.  Prior to discharge, the patient's labetalol was 
decreased to 200 mg BID.  She remained normotensive.  She should 
follow up with her PCP for ___ blood pressure check on discharge.

History of Present Illness:
___ with PMHx of COPD, OSA on CPAP, current smoker, and HTN 
presenting with increasing shortness of breath, cough, and chest 
tightness similar to prior COPD exacerbations.

Patient was in her USOH until a couple of weeks ago when she 
developed a cold (rhinorrhea, cough, sinus pressure, etc.). She 
reports that at that time she also started to have some 
worsening dyspnea and whezzing. She called her pulmonologist 
(Dr. ___ and was prescribed a short course of prednisone. She 
got slightly better when she again noticed the return of her 
symptoms over the last week. She also noted that her cough which 
is usually dry or productive of clear/white sputum had become 
productive of yellow/green sputum. She also developed worsening 
wheezing and chest tightness. Compounding her issues, she ran 
out of her home nebulizer treatments which she thought had been 
helping to keep her symptoms at bay. Denied fevers, abdominal 
pain, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or myalgias. Reports 
mild chills and nausea. She then decided to come into the ___ 
ED for evaluation.  
 
In the ED:  
Initial vital signs were notable for T 98.9, HR 86, BP 142/96, 
RR 40, O2 92% on RA.  

Labs were notable for:  
- WBC 12.9, Hbg 10.6  
- VBG pH 7.39, pCO2 51, O2sat 95  
- Chemistries, renal function wnl, troponin neg x 1 CXR showed a 
subtle increase in opacity at the right lung base, which could 
be due to overlapping structures, but could not exclude definite 
consolidation.  

Patient was given:  
- 500mg IV azithromycin  
- 40mg PO prednisone  
- Duonebs  

The pt triggered in the ED for tachypnea and chest tightness, 
with respiratory rates in the ___. Both the pt's tachypnea and 
symptoms improved after administration of duonebs. She was 
admitted to the medicine service for further management.  

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was breathing comfortably 
and said that her SOB seemed to have improved after the 
nebulizer treatments in the ED. She was hungry and requested 
dinner. 
 
Regarding the pt's relevant pulmonary history, recent pulmonary 
function tests demonstrate features of moderate obstruction. She 
has an FEV1 of 42% predicted with an FVC of 53% predicted ratio 
62%. She continues to smoke cigarettes daily but is down to 
about one cig every other day.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of COPD, OSA 
on CPAP, current smoking, and HTN who presented with increasing 
shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness similar to prior 
COPD exacerbations. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:  
============== 
#COPD EXACERBATION: 
Ms. ___ presented with dyspnea, cough with changes in 
sputum production, and chest tightness consistent with her prior 
COPD exacerbations. This episode was likely triggered by a 
recent URI and unfortunately exacerbated by her running out of 
her home nebulizer treatments. CXR PA/lateral did not 
demonstrate overlying pneumonia and flu swab was negative. She 
was initiated on a 5 day course of PO prednisone 40mg and 
azithromycin (___), treated with duonebs and albuterol, and 
managed symptomatically for her cough.

#LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA:
Ms. ___ also endorsed bilateral non-pitting edema, left 
worse than right, for one week. LENIs were negative for DVT or 
popliteal fossa cyst. There were no other signs of volume 
overload on exam, and her BNP was 35. The edema could be an 
amlodipine side effect, though would not expect asymmetry and 
she has been on this medication (at the same dosage) for 
multiple years.

STABLE ISSUES:  
===============  
#THYROID MASS:
Previously noted to be benign per biopsy results at ___, however 
increasing in size per review of OMR. Ms. ___ was due to 
have repeat thyroid U/S roughly 6 months ago, but had yet to 
receive it in the outpatient setting. Therefore the study was 
performed while the patient was admitted. This demonstrated 
""Numerous confluent nodules in the right lobe suggest an overall 
stable appearance although specific measurements are difficult 
to obtain due to differences in scanning technique. Two left 
lobe nodules are minimally increased in size compared to the 
prior ultrasound.  No new worrisome nodule is identified within

___ 06:20AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.8 Mg-2.___ year old male with hx of COPD p/w with increased shortness of 
breath. He was found to have influenza, COPD exacerbation, ___ 
on CKD and lower extremity edema. He was treated with 
oseltamivir, prednisone, and azithromcyin. He left against 
medical advice one day prior to planned discharge. 

# Influenza/pneumonia: Patient presented with fever, cough with 
green sputum and flu positivity with CXR suggesting right lung 
consolidation. Patient received ceftriaxone and azithromycin in 
the ED for bacterial pneumonia/COPD exacerbation and was started 
on Oseltamivir for influenza. Given that patient appeared 
clinically well without elevated wbc, ceftriaxone was 
discontinued (as bacterial pneumonia was less suspected). His 
cough improved with treatment. He was unable to be weaned off of 
supplemental O2 (ambulatory saturation on discharge 86%) and he 
was discharged with supplemental O2. Lingering O2 requirment 
likely due to infection in setting of COPD. 

# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Most likely due to obstruction 
secondary to BPH. Admission creatinine was 3.1, up from a 
baseline of 2.8. FeNA was 11%, consistent with obstruction. 
Patient had good urine output, so he did not have foley placed. 
Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. Cr continued to 
uptrend and stabilized at 3.7. FeUrea on day of discharge was 
53%, suggestive of more of an intrinsic pathology - likely ATN 
secondary to obstructive acute kidney injury. He also had 
increased UOP, suggestive of post-ATN diuresis. 

 # Lower extremity edema: Patient presented with 3+ pitting 
edema to the knees bilaterally. He does not have a history of 
congestive heart failure but BNP was elevated to 3750, which is 
consistent with heart failure diagnosis. Patient received IVFs 
on admission which may have further exacerbated the issue. No 
evidence to suggest heart failure causing his dyspnea symptoms. 
No lasix was given due to ___, however, patient autodiuresed and 
swelling was minimal on discharge. He should have outpatient 
echocardiogram. 

# Nausea: Patient had onset of nausea and difficulty tolerating 
PO. He reported that this sometimes occurs at home. He was given 
reglan and a GI cocktail with little effect. Most likely due to 
oseltamivir side effect vs, less likely, gastroparesis. Patient 
was tolerating clears when he left against medical advice. 

# COPD with acute exacerbation: Patient has a history of COPD 
not on home O2. His presentation was also consistent with a COPD 
exacerbation. He received steroids and azithromycin in the ED. 
He continued PO prednisone for a planned 5 day total course. He 
was unable to be weaned off of supplemental O2 (ambulatory 
saturation on discharge 86%) and he was discharged with 
supplemental O2. Lingering O2 requirment likely due to infection 
in setting of COPD. 

# Hyperkalemia: Likely from CKD. This was within normal limits 
on discharge. 

# Type 2 DM (diabetes mellitus), noninsulin dependent: Last 
HbA1C 6.5 in ___. Patient on glimepiride at home. 
Glimepiride was held on admission but restarted on discharge.  

# Hypertension: He continued home labetalol and amlodipine. 

# CAD: He continued home aspirin and statin.  

# BPH: He continued home finasteride and tamsulosin 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Discharge weight: 92.9 kg

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with PMH of COPD on 2L NC, 
CAD s/p CABG, DM, Afib s/p ablation, who presents with 
lightheadedness and was found to have ___ and orthostatic 
hypotension.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Lightheadedness/presyncope: Neuro exam was normal on 
admission. He did not have arrhythmias or signs of ischemia on 
EKG and telemetry overnight was without arrhythmia. NCHCT was 
normal, without evidence of stroke/bleed. Based on history, his 
episode appeared more consistent with presyncope, and 
orthostatic vital signs support this diagnosis. He also had ___ 
that improved with IVF which is evidence of dehydration though 
he denies that he has had reduced intake. Even though ___ 
improved, he continued to have orthostatic VS with SBP going 
from 160 to 100 from lying to standing. Could possibly have 
autonomic dysfunction as he does not appear dehydrated anymore.

# ___ on CKD stage III - His Cr was elevated at 2.1 which 
improved to 1.5 with 1L IVF which is his baseline. Losartan was 
held on admission but restarted at discharge.

#Orthostatic hypotension: Patient had positive orthostatic vital 
signs on admission and also after IVF, concerning for some 
possible autonomic dysfunction versus medication effect. Now 
that Cr is improved, will discharge on losartan for HTN, but 
will hold amlodipine as it can worsen orthostatic hypotension.

#Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb was 18 even with improvement in ___. 
Based on prior nephrology note, has history of metabolic 
acidosis which had been attributed to his CKD. Continue to 
monitor and follow up with ___ clinic.

#Macrocytic anemia: Has normal Hgb but with MCV elevated to low

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were transferred to ___ in 
___ with multiple right-sided rib fractures after a fall.  
You were admitted to the Trauma Surgery Service for pain control 
and to monitor your breathing. While in the hospital, you worked 
with Physical Therapy and it is recommended that you have 
Physical Therapy services come to your home to help you regain 
your strength. You are now ready to be discharged home.  Please 
note the following discharge instructions:

* Your injury caused right-sided rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic 
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  

___ CXR
In comparison with the study of ___, there is again 
enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of some pulmonary 
vascular congestion. Areas of increased opacification are seen 
at both bases with apparent silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. This 
most likely represents combination of atelectasis and effusion, 
though superimposed pneumonia be definitely excluded.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH of CHF, depression, AAA, GERD presenting with 
altered mental status and hypotension, found to have sepsis 
likely due to a multi-lobar pneumonia admitted to the ICU for 
two days and transferred to medical floor on ___. She did 
not require tracheal intubation in the ICU.

1. Pneumonia: Urine legionella negative, blood cultures (NGTD 
from ___, viral culture negative. Patient improved on 
Vanc/Zosyn with steady improvement in her oxygen saturation to 
normal on RA at the time of discharge. She received an 8day 
course of antibiotics, then they were discontinued.  Oxygen was 
given and eventually weaned off.  Asnoted above, she did not 
require tracheal intubation in the ICU.

2. Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial due to pneumonia, and a 
component of diastolic congestive heart failure with volume 
resuscitation in the ER. Initial BNP elevated, and blood 
tests/EKG did not reveal suggestive myocardial injury. Patient 
responded well to intermittent doses of Lasix 10mg IV. 

3. Hypertension: Pt had episodes of hypotension at presentation; 
on the general medicine floor she remained intermitently 
hypertensive to SBP=180 despite Labetalol 200mg BID, which is 
her home regiment. Elevated values tended to be right before 
next dose of medicine is given; otherwise relatively 
well-controlled.  on discharge =150s/70s

4. Chronic diastolic CHF: TTE obtained this hospitalization 
showed EF>55%, no echocardiographic evidence of diastolic 
dysfunction, only mild LVH on TTE. She was continued on 
Labetalol as above for BP and rate control.

5. Anemia: Hct improved slowly to 31 at the time of discharge, 
MCV=89, baseline unknown. Given MCV, likely due to anemia of 
chronic disease, eval studies were consistent with this.

6. Lumbar disc disease - s/p lumbar surgery.  Back pain was 
slightly worse in hospital and so her Oxycontin to increased to 
40mg BID on ___ with good effect.  Not requireing breakthrough 
pain.  Valium was decreased to 2mg BID, and she's being 
discharged on 2mg once daily prn anxiety. She has not displayed 
high levels of anxiety, though the valium had been given to her 
prior to hospitalization more to help any spasm component of her 
back pain.

4. Flexor digitorum longus release.
5. Posterior tibial tendon release.

 
History of Present Illness:
I am seeing your patient today in the ___ clinic.  I am
seeing this patient today for review.  She has had unfortunately
a fall approximately one and half weeks ago.  She had a twisting
injury.  She has had pain in the ankle since that time.

She does not describe any changes in her health.  Her past
medical history has been documented including diabetes.

I examined her today and found that she has some tenderness on
deep palpation of medial or lateral aspects of her ankle.  No
complaints of any calf pain or calf swelling to suggest deep 
vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolus.

IMAGING:  I reviewed her x-rays that show evidence of an acute
fracture involving her ankle joint, specifically a bimalleolar
ankle fracture.  She does have underlying Charcot arthropathy.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I had a discussion today with ___
regarding management.  I am concerned regarding her new 
fracture.
 We have talked about treatment.  We have talked about surgical
intervention to address her deformity; however, I am concerned
about adding additional hardware because of her history of
noncompliance and the risk of deep infection that may require
additional procedures including a possible below-knee 
amputation.

We will go ahead and make the appropriate arrangements for her 
to
have her procedure done to stabilize the ankle and again, we 
will
try to avoid any hardware that would not be removed at a later
date.  She also is aware of the possibility that she may require
a fusion type procedure as if she continues to have instability
involving the ankle.

I have answered all of her questions.  She was given specific
instructions regarding followup.  She is to remain
nonweightbearing.  She understands signs and symptoms associated
with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus.

dissection of the portal vein and jailing of right PV posterior 
branches. TIPS was extended into main PV with luminex stents, 
dilated to 10 mm. post procedure gradient approx 15, similar to 
preprocedure gradient. 5 L paracentesis. approx 470 cc contrast 
used. Pt reported abd soreness ""like punched"" which improved

CT ABD/PELVIS ___
1. Likely mild proctitis without a perirectal abscess or bowel 
obstruction. 
2. The known metastatic lesion in the right hepatic lobe 
measuring up to 6.6 cm, is slightly large in size since prior 
exam from ___, when it measured up to 6.2 cm.  The 
adjacent hepatic parenchyma in segment VI and VII enhances 
heterogeneously raising suspicion for satellite metastases. 
Unchanged appearance of occluded right hepatic vein and right 
branch of the portal vein. 
3. Subacute healing pathologic fracture is again seen in the 
left lateral 
tenth rib.  Unchanged compression deformities of the L3-L5 
vertebrae. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with a past medical history of hypertension NIDDM2, 
HLD, stable angina, hearing loss and metastatic pancreatic 
cancer s/p Whipple on palliative chemotherapy, who presented 
with 6 days of diarrhea and 2 days of nausea and
vomiting likely ___ recent chemotherapy and a urinary tract 
infection.

ACUTE ISSUES
#Complicated urinary tract infection
Despite lack of symptoms, due to a history of recurrent urinary 
infections and ongoing fevers, we sent for a UA and urine 
culture. The patient was found to have a grossly positive UA and 
culture grew pan-sensitive E. Coli. The patient was initially 
placed on Zosyn and was discharged to complete a 7 day course of 
Bactrim DS. Given recurrent urinary tract infections, urology 
was consulted and they recommended continuing prophylactic 
Bactrim SS indefinitely. He will be following up with urology 
outpatient.

#Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
#Poor PO intake
Patient with one week of diarrhea and several days of nausea and 
vomiting. C4D1 of chemotherapy was ___. Diarrhea is a 
common adverse effect of onivyde. Given patient had a 2 month 
break from chemotherapy, it is possible that this was a rebound 
effect in the setting of drug break. The patient was also 
complaining of chills and sweats concerning for possible 
infectious etiology. During his last admission, he had GNR 
bacteremia and was treated with meropenem and discharged on 
ertapenem with course finishing ___. On this admission, C. 
Diff and Legionella were negative. Nausea and vomiting resolved 
rapidly with symptomatic treatment. He was able to eat, but 
continued to have diarrhea throughout hospital course. It 
resolved prior to discharge with loperamide. Stool, blood and 
urine cultures were all negative to date.

#Proctitis:
CT with mild proctitis. DDx included anal fissures/fistulas, C. 
Diff, diverticulitis, infectious, IBD, traumatic. In this case, 
it was likely due to inflammation from severe diarrhea.

#Hyponatremia:
This was noted on admission and believed to be likely hypotonic 
hypovolemic in the setting of poor PO intake and less likely 
SIADH. Na was noted to be 133 on ___ at appointment prior for 
chemotherapy, and believed to be ___ poor PO intake. Na 138 on 
___.

#Metastatic pancreatic cancer
Followed by oncologist Dr. ___. His current regimen is 
___ which he recently received on ___ for 
palliative chemotherapy. Palliative care was consulted to 
discuss GOC and symptom management. Patient will follow closely 
with Dr. ___ discharge to discuss next steps.

CHRONIC ISSUES
#Anemia
Baseline around ___ at recent admission. Patient remained around 
baseline and did not require any transfusions. 

#Hx of stable angina
EKG on admission with no evidence of ST segment changes. 
Troponins negative x1.

#Hypertension:
He was continued on amlodipine, lisinopril. Metoprolol was held 
during this admission as it was held on discharge at last 
admission. Given blood pressures were slightly elevated while 
inpatient, patient may benefit from restarting metoprolol.

#Diabetes:
Patient placed on insulin sliding scale while inpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
[]Last day of Bactrim DS for UTI ___
[]Given recurrent UTIs, urology consulted and recommended 
prophylactic Bactrim SS indefinitely, will need to follow 
closely with urology outpatient
[]Patient has had numerous hospitalizations and poor tolerance 
to chemo, would benefit from conversations with outpatient 
oncologist Dr. ___ plan moving forward
[]Will need ongoing conversations regarding code status
[]Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea resolved with symptomatic 
treatment but will likely require titration of symptomatic 
medications to ensure doesn't become constipated; encourage 
patient to take loperamide for symptomatic relief
[]Patient seems somewhat confused about medication regimen, 
would benefit from clarification or help with medication 
management
[]BPs mostly 140s/60s while inpatient but going up to SBPs 160s 
prior to discharge on amlodipine and lisinopril. metoprolol was 
held on discharge but patient would benefit from ongoing BP 
monitoring and may need to restart metoprolol.
[]Patient would benefit from ongoing follow up with nutrition as 
PO intake appears somewhat poor at baseline and albumin was 3.1.

REPORTS: 

___   Radiology CARDIAC PERFUSION PERSA  Left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. The end-diastolic volume is 
129 ml.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a small region of 
decreased tracer
uptake along the inferior wall of the left ventricle, although 
this may be due to artifact generated by adjacent soft tissue. 
There is no change in tracer uptake on stress versus rest 
images.
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 68 %.
No prior studies are available for comparison.
IMPRESSION: 1. No reversible myocardial perfusion defect. 2. 
Focal decreased tracer uptake in the left ventricular inferior 
wall is likely due to artifact from adjacent soft tissue; 
alternatively this could represent a mild fixed perfusion 
defect.
     
___   Cardiology STRESS ___: ___ yo 
man with h/o HTN, HL and type II DM requiring
insulin; s/p ""small heart attack"" ___ years ago was referred to 
evaluate
an atypical chest discomfort and shortness of breath. The 
patient was
administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4 minutes. No 
chest,
back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the patient 
during the
procedure. No significant ST segment changes were noted. The 
rhythm was
sinus with no ectopy noted. An appropriate heart rate and blood 
pressure
response to the Persantine infusion was noted. Post-infusion, 
the
patient was administered 125 mg Aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes 
to
Persantine. Appropriate heart rate and blood pressure response 
to
Persantine infusion. Nuclear report sent separately.  
 
___   Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)   
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are mildly diminished. Hazy subsegmental 
atelectasis
is seen in both lung bases. No consolidation or edema is 
evident. The
mediastinum is unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is 
borderline enlarged
even accounting for patient and technical factors. No effusion 
or
pneumothorax is noted. The osseous structures are grossly 
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with hazy bibasilar atelectasis. 
Otherwise, no
acute pulmonary process.

History of Present Illness:
 Mrs. ___ is a ___ y.o. female with a past history of 
COPD/Asthma, who reported increased dyspnea over approximately 
one week.  Apparently, her husband came home almost a week ago 
with a ""cold"" and she then developed a non-productive cough, 
malaise, dyspnea on exertion and eventually an inability to 
sleep due to dyspnea.  She denied the presence of fevers, 
chills, or chest pain.  Over the past 3 days her dyspnea 
increased and today she appeared in significant distress.  She 
was brought to the ED.  She has had several admissions in the 
past for dyspnea/COPD exacerbation, has been on BiPAP, never 
been intubated.
.  
In the ED on arrival, VS:  Temp 98.8; BP 129/61; HR 95; RR 28; 
SpO2 80% on RA.  She arrived ambulatory from home with family 
(who reported cough productive with yellow sputum).  Blood gases 
after 3.5 L for 4 minutes revealed hypoxia with PO2 61 and PCO2 
47.  She received 3 combivent nebs with marked improvement. A 
CXR was suggestive of pneumonia.  She was given prednisone and 
levofloxacin and admitted for COPD exacerbation/pneumonia.  On 
transfer to the floor, VS: Temp 98.8; BP 140/47; HR 102; RR 20; 
SpO2 93% on 3L.
.  
Currently, her dyspnea is much better.  She denied chest pain, 
or other symptoms.  Her daughter, a nurse, was with her and able 
to assist with much of the history, as the patient reproted her 
memory was poor.  Her daughter reported that the patient became 
confused during previous admission.
.  
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision 
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, chest pain, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, 
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.  She refuses to have a 
mammogram or colonoscopy.

LABS ON DISCHARGE:
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. woman with a past history of COPD and asthma that 
presented with increasing dyspnea and cough.  
.  
# Dyspnea: Likely due to COPD exacerbation with pneumonia 
suggested by CXR. ___ have occured in the setting of a URI given 
her husband's recent cold symptoms, but may also be due 
COPD/asthma exacerbation alone. Respiratory status has improved 
significantly since she presented to the ED. Infleunza was 
negative Does not appear to be volume overloaded, making CHF 
less likely. PE unlikely given her presentation and response to 
bronchodilators. Given her baseline respiratory dysfunction, she 
will likely need pulmonary rehab prior to returning home. She is 
not a candidate for home oxygen because she continues to smoke.  
If she can quit, she should start on nighttime home oxygen. 
Smoking cessation was discussed.  She had a nicotine patch and 
was discharged on chantix.  She plans not to smoke on this 
medication and knows to watch for depression and altered dreams.
She was discharged with a steroid taper, plan to complete a 10 
day course of antibiotics, and nebs for COPD/Asthma.  She should 
continue oxygen as needed. 
.  
Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC prior to steroids. Decreased during 
admission. Likely related to pneumonia, as suggested by CXR. 
This trended down.  
.  
# Hypertension: Well controlled with home medications. HCTZ, 
metoprolol and norvasc were continued, BP remained stable.  
.  
# Type II Diabetes: Glucose checks qid, standing coverage with 
70/30 and sliding scale.  Her 70/30 was increased while on 
prednisone and she was started on metformin.
.  
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued her simvastatin.  
.  
# Peripheral Neuropathy: Continued with her gabapentin.  
.  
# ? Dementia: Patient is on aricept, she and her daughter 
reported forgetfulness. Aricept was continued and she was 
monitored closely for delerium.  
.  
# CODE: Remains FULL code at this time. Patient did express that 
she may not want to be resuscitated/intubated, but further 
discussion with patient and family is required. She does not 
have a health care proxy.  
.  
# CONTACT: With patient and her daughter.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital.  You were 
admitted for chest pain.  The major concern was that this was 
related to your heart.  All the testing done, including lab work 
and EKGs were very reassuring and it was unlikely this was 
related to a problem with your heart.  It may have been related 
to your cervical stenosis or it may have been a muscle pull, 
strain, or sprain.  You should keep taking all of your 
medications exactly as prescribed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo man with a history of NSTEMI s/p s/p 
DES to LAD (___), LCX (___) who presented with right sided 
light chest pressure at rest which was similar to his previous 
NSTEMIs. Of note, he described holding his aspirin and 
clopidogrel for a Dermatology procedure.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
# NSTEMI
# Community acquired pneumonia

He was noted to have an NSTEMI with troponins peaking at 0.03. 
His EKG was unremarkable for ischemic change, normal sinus 
rhythm, TWI in V1, no STE, unchanged from prior. He was placed 
on a heparin gtt with a plan for cardiac catheterization. 
However, patient declined cardiac catheterization given his 
desire for no invasive procedures. He also declines reversal of 
code status from DNR/DNI for procedures. He is on Plavix, 
aspirin, carvidilol, atorvastatin 80, and lisinopril-HCTZ at 
home, and these were continued. Also, we counseled the patient 
yesterday that he could NOT,
under any circumstances, discontinue his DAPT without a 
cardiologist's permission.

In addition, he was noted to have a retrocardiac opacity, 
leukocytosis, and a history of cough x2-3 weeks. He was started 
on levofloxacin 750 mg x5 days with planned course from 
___.

Unfortunately, before our team could prepare his discharge 
paperwork, he walked to the nursing station dressed and shouted 
that we had ""no regard for patient care."" I asked him to stay 
for just a few minutes so that we could prepare the ___ and 
homemaker services he had requested earlier, but he declined, 
saying that we were just trying to ""CYA."" He did not leave with 
his prescription for levofloxacin, or his ___ services 
arranged. We forwarded this information to PCP and ___ 
in hopes they can assist with his follow-up care. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- NSTEMI likely precipitated by holding DAPT - iterate in the 
outpatient setting that he cannot discontinue these medications
- Levofloxacin 750 mg daily (___) for community acquired 
PNA was prescribed but NOT completed, and he should be queried 
specifically for PNA symptoms at next outpatient f/u
- Patient planned for cardiology appointment in ___ with 
Dr. ___ would recommend follow up in the next month 
with cardiology. Patient vocalized that he would make an 
appointment within the next month to see cardiology.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were seen at ___ for the light chest 
pressure you felt in your chest that was the same as you 
experienced before with your heart attacks. You did have 
elevation of troponins, which indicates a lack of blood flow to 
your heart. This is concerning for ischemia, or the beginning of 
a heart attack. We placed you on a medication called heparin to 
prevent ischemia. Your troponins trended down, and your EKG was 
normal. You were seen by our cardiology team, who felt that you 
should have a cardiac catheterization to evaluate your heart 
vessels and stents. You declined this procedure as it is not 
within your goals of care. 

In addition, you were noted to have a pneumonia, and we are 
treating you with antibiotics. Please continue these until 
___.

We are keeping you on your home medications. Please follow up 
with your appointments that we have arranged. Please follow up 
with your cardiologist Dr. ___ the next month as we 
discussed.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Your ___ team

Pertinent Results:
Studies

Stress test ___

% MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  89

IMPRESSION: Poor exercise tolerance with the test being 
terminated 
secondary to an exaggerated systolic blood pressure response 
with 
exercise. No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes. 
Echo 
report sent separately. 

TTE ___

The patient exercised for 4 minutes and 30 seconds according to 
a Modified ___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak 
heart rate of 142 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 256/80 mmHg. 
The test was stopped because of a hypertensive response. This 
level of exercise represents a poor exercise tolerance for age 
and gender. In response to stress, the ECG showed no ST-T wave 
changes (see exercise report for details). with an abnormal 
increase in blood pressure/hypertensive response and a normal 
heart rate response to stress. 
 .
 Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 63 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 170/96 mmHg. These demonstrated normal 
regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right 
ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Doppler demonstrated no aortic stenosis, aortic 
regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation or resting 
LVOT gradient. .

 Echo images were acquired within 46 seconds after peak stress 
at heart rates of 131 - 108 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate 
augmentation of all left ventricular segments with slight 
decrease in cavity size. There was augmentation of right 
ventricular free wall motion. 

 IMPRESSION: Test stopped because of hypertension. No ECG or 2D 
echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved 
workload. Marked hypertensive response to exercise.

who presents as transfer from ___ with NSTEMI. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
#NSTEMI
#CAD s/p PCI in ___
The patien's presentation in the setting of his significant 
coronary artery disease, status post PCI, and similarity of 
chest pain to prior episodes when he was diagnosed with MI, was 
consistent with an ischemic process underlying his chest pain. 
Elevated troponin at OSH prior to arrival was consistent with 
NSTEMI. Troponins at ___ were negative and EKGs after transfer 
negative for changes suggesting active ischemia. Given these 
negative findings, IV heparin was discontinued and the patient 
underwent a stress test for further risk stratification which 
was negative for anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes 
in the setting of appropiate heart rate response to exercise. 
Given the stress test results, the decision was made to defer 
cardiac catheterization at this point. Aspirin and high dose 
atorvastatin were continued. In addition, the patient was 
started on metoprolol to optimize anti-anginal treatment and 
lisinopril for blood pressure management.

___
Cr 1.3 on admission, baseline unknown; improved to 1.2 in ED. 
Creatinine on discharge stable at 1.2. Potassium stable at 4.3. 
Please obtain BMP on follow up with one to two weeks to monitor 
renal function and potassium

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
#Hypertension
The patient had been on lisinopril as an outpatient in the past 
(but wasn't taking any his medications for several months prior 
to admission). No anti-hypertensives were given on admission in 
setting of initial ___ and potential catheterization. Systolic 
blood pressures were subsequently between 150-160 and the 
patient was started on Lisinopril 10mg dialy.
- Follow-up as an outpatient with uptitration of 
anti-hypertensives as tolerated is recommended. 

#Non-insulin dependent diabetes
A1c 6.7% on labs ___ at ___. Patient does not report any
medications to treat this issue at this time. Not started on 
Metformin as he was newly started on Lisinopril with possible 
worsening of his renal function 
- Metformin should be started as an outpatient if his renal 
function allows

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Discharge Creatinine 1.2; potassium on discharge 4.3 (both 
stable) [] Please repeat BMP within two weeks of discharge to 
ensure resolution ___ and to monitor potassium (newly started 
on Lisinopril)
[] Newly started on Lisinopril 20mg daily - follow-up blood 
pressure, consider uptitration of lisinopril as tolerated by 
renal function and electrolytes
[] Patient also started on Metoprolol succinate 25mg, aspirin 
81mg daily and atorvastatin 80mg daily during this admission; 
please continue this medications in the outpatient setting

# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: CHADS2=3 
(HTN, CHF, Age). Underwent workup for etiology of new atrial 
fibrillation at last admission. She returned with rapid atrial 
fibrillation but no signs of systolic heart failure 
exacerbation. Rate control strategy was favored given paroxysmal 
nature of her atrial fibrillation despite being euvolemic as 
volume overload was initially felt to be a contributing factor. 
She was rate controlled on increased dose of metoprolol and her 
symptoms of fatigue resolved. She also continued Rivaroxaban for 
stroke prevention. 
   
# Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation: Has 
dilated cardiomyopathy. Appears euvolemic on exam with flat JVP. 
She has crackles but no dyspnea or other signs of volume 
overload on exam. She was discharged on low dose of lasix to 
take outpatient to prevent volume overload as her JVP had 
increased slightly over the course of the hospitalization 
(although remains <10) and her weight was increased from her 
prior discharge weight. She is now lacking her atrial kick to 
aid with forward flow. She was instructed to monitor her weights 
outpatient. 

# Leg Pain: Felt to be from trochanteric bursitis outpatient. No 
acute fracture was seen on imaging. DVT was ruled out with 
ultrasound last admission. Continued Tylenol for pain control 
and physical therapy was consulted.

# Hypertension: Her home olmesartan and Felodipine continued to 
be held from last admission. Metoprolol was given per above. She 
should restart her ___ outpatient as she has systolic heart 
failure if her blood pressure permits. 
  

HOSPITAL ISSUES:   
- Code: Full Code  
- should have BP check at follow up outpatient visit and restart 
___ if BP allows
- CTA last hospitalization showed incidental finding of 
narrowing of the left 
mainstem bronchus with soft tissue fullness posteriorly and 
distal esophageal thickening. This can be further worked up if 
clinically indicated.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ year old female, history of CAD (MI ___ s/p
PCIx2 to ramus intermedius, TTE ___, pAF (on Coumadin),
moderate AS, HTN, anemia, dementia, GERD, and hx breast cancer
(s/p R mastectomy with XRT) who presents with chest pain. 
Patient
reports that symptoms began 2 or 3 days ago. She reports 8 out 
of
10 substernal chest ""pressure."" Mild dyspnea with cough. No
hemoptysis. Denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, change in
bowel or bladder function, change in vision or hearing, 
bruising,
adenopathy, new rash or lesion.

She is somewhat difficult to get a clear history from w/r/t her
pain. When it initially started about 48 hours ago, it awoke her
up out of her sleep. She doesn't recall anything that improved 
or
made it worse, but since then it has been rather episodic
throughout the day. She has felt generally ""low energy"" and thus
has not been moving about all that much, but when she has 
exerted
herself she does not think that brought about the pain or made 
it
any worse. She does think that she has felt generally weaker
while exerting herself over the last week or so.

PATIENT SUMMARY:
====================
___ year old female, history of CAD (MI ___ s/p PCIx2 to ramus
intermedius, TTE ___, pAF (on Coumadin), moderate AS, HTN,
anemia, dementia, GERD, and hx breast cancer (s/p R mastectomy

symptomatic severe AS vs. non-cardiac.

RHYTHM: pAF

====================
ACTIVE ISSUES
====================

#Chest pain
#CAD (MI ___ s/p PCIx2 to ramus intermedius, last cath ___
with 3VD, declining intervention)
Suspect that some of her chest pain is anginal in nature, though
not entirely clear from her history. Low concern for ACS given 
very mild trop elevation which was downtrending and no ischemic 
EKG changes. Pmibi was reassuring. Notably long acting nitrates 
have resulted in HA in the past. Beta blocker not uptitrated due 
to resting bradycardia. Also, she recently had two episodic 
visits for diffuse muscle aches and fatigue, with labs showing 
mildly elevated CK; statin was discontinued in this setting. ASA 
was also held on her last admission due to concern for GIB. Her 
symptoms were resolved on the day of discharge.

#pAF: On warfarin. INR on admission 3.3 so Warfarin held on 
admission day but resumed on ___. Patient was in sinus this 
admission. Continued Amiodarone but Carvedilol 3.125 BID held 
due to resting bradycardia. INR on discharge was 2.3.

#Moderate-Severe AS: AS valve area of 1cm, with mean gradient 
36.
This is slightly worsened in the past year with prior area
measured at 1.1cm with mean gradient in the low ___. Aortic 
stenosis will be discussed further at outpatient visit with 
___.

#Diffuse muscle aches: Given vague nature of symptoms, certainly 
possible that her pain was related to neither AS nor ischemic 
heart disease. Interestingly, her CK and AST were both elevated 
on admission likely indicating some skeletal muscle breakdown. 
Statin induced myopathy is certainly possible so continued to 
hold her Atorvastatin, though other myopathies should be 
considered. CRP mildly elevated and ESR pending on discharge. 
TSH also checked which was normal. 

#HTN: Holding carvedilol but continued amlodipine as above.

#Dementia
#Anxiety:
Continued home wellbutrin and mirtazapine.

#CKD: Appeared to be at baseline Cr from most recent checks. Cr 
on discharge was 1.1.

#Chest pain: Felt to be esophageal spasm in the setting of GERD. 
EKG unchanged from prior and tropopnins were negative. CTA 
otherwise negative for PE. Pt was started on a PPI, and he had 
only minor recurrence of chest pain after coming to the floor. 
Pt was discharged with a PPT as well as a plan for follow up EGD 
with possible barium swallow.

#Shortness of Breath: Pt's shortness of breath was felt to be 
related to his inability to take a deep breath due to pain. His 
desaturation in the ED may have been related to the pain 
medications he was administered. Pt's oxygen was quickly weanes 
off an admission, and his respiratory status remained stable 
during this admission.

#Hepatitis B: Pt was continued on ___

#Cirrhosis s/p OLT: MELD score 10. Pt was continued on home 
Prograf. Level was 3.1 on morning of discharge.

workup for cardiac chest pain, which was negative and with a
diagnosis of stress.  He is on Lamictal and Geodon for bipolar
depression.  He is allergic to amoxicillin.  He smokes
approximately half a pack a day, which is a decrease from the 
two
packs.

His films were reviewed, which show a grade ___ 
spondylolisthesis
at L5-S1 with spondylolysis.  An MRI was reviewed from 
___
from ___ MRI, which shows a bilateral L5 spondylolysis and
L5-S1 spondylolisthesis that is grade 2.  There is severe
foraminal stenosis bilaterally.

On physical examination, he is an alert and oriented male. 
Affect is within normal limits.  He has an antalgic gait.  He 
has
___ strength bilaterally with a ___ ___ and abductors.  His

has
severe left back as well as left lower extremity radicular
symptoms.  We talked about possible surgical intervention.  This
would either be an anterior-posterior fusion with interbody 
cages
from ___ versus a strut graft through the sacrum and L5 combined
with a posterolateral fusion.  We discussed this at length as
well as risks and benefits using models as MRI.  All questions
were answered.  I would like to obtain a CT scan and see him 
back
in followup.  I gave him a surgical packet and asked him to look
at the animations and come back with any questions.  Given his
x-rays and MRIs as well as clinical symptoms, I do recommend
surgical intervention.

Final Report 
PORTABLE CHEST:  ___. 
  
HISTORY:  ___ female with respiratory distress.  
Question pneumonia. 
  
COMPARISON:  ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  Streaky linear opacities are again seen, similar to 
prior and may 
be due to atelectasis.  There is no confluent consolidation.  
Costophrenic 
angles are sharp.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within 
normal limits.  
Rounded calcific density overlying the anterior left seventh rib 
is compatible 
with calcification at the costochondral junction.  No acute 
osseous 
abnormality is detected. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidations to suggest pneumonia. 

=======

Final Report CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS) Study Date of 
___ 1:45 ___
HISTORY:  History of COPD with shortness of breath and 2new 
eft-sided tender 
neck mass.  Rule out infection versus mass. 
  
COMPARISON:  Prior neck soft tissue ultrasound from ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Routine enhanced MDCT study of the neck was 
performed with images 
obtained from the skullbase to the thoracic inlet using 3 mm 
thick sections.  
Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed.  
  
Total exam DLP:  394 mGy-cm. 
  
FINDINGS: 
  
Evaluation of the aerodigestive tract demonstrates no exophytic 
mucosal mass, 
there is no focal mass effect.  There is mild mucosal thickening 
of the 
maxillary sinuses bilaterally and ethmoidal air cells, worse on 
the left.  
Evaluation of the cervical lymph chains demonstrate no 
pathologic 
lymphadenopathy by imaging criteria.  The thyroid gland is 
normal.  The left 
salivary gland appears slightly larger than the left however no 
focal 
abnormality is identified.  Adjacent to the left salivary gland 
however, there 
is a heterogeneous soft tissue lesion similar in appearance to 
the left 
parotid gland, measuring 2 x 2 cm and demonstrating fat density. 
 This lesion 
seems to connect to the parotid gland and could correlate to the 
lesion 
identified on prior ultrasound.  There appears to be surrounding 
fat stranding 
and thickening of the adjacent tissues (5 b: 36, 04:39).  There 
is however no 
definite enhancement to suggest abscess formation.  Neck vessels 
enhance 
bilaterally without significant stenosis.   
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
2 x 2 cm heterogeneous soft tissue lesion adjacent to the left 
salivary gland 
with apparent connection to the parotid gland, similar in 
appearance to 
parotid tissue, demonstrating fatty density and surrounding fat 
stranding 
could represent an extension of normal parotid tissue with 
possible early 
signs of inflammatory changes, given surrounding fat stranding.  
However, no 
definite enhancement is seen to suggest abscess formation. This 
lesion likely 
correlates to lesion seen on prior ultrasound. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

placement on ___ admitted with fever, RUL infiltrate consistent 
with PNA.

# RUL bacterial pneumonia: Pt developed fever and increased 
sputum production following last admission for endobronchial 
coil placement. He was started on levofloxacin as an outpatient 
and shortly after admitted to OSH where he received 
vanc/piperacillin-tazobactam for several days and was discharged 
home on levofloxacin. He experienced recurrent fever at home and 
was advised to present to ___ where CXR showed RUL 
consolidation infiltrate, most likely postobstructive PNA in 
area of coiling procedure given fevers, change in sputum 
production and temporary clinical improvement while on broad 
spectrum abx at OSH. He was initially treated with 
vanc/piperacillin-tazobactam /levofloxacin. Notably, BAL from 
___ on last admission grew resistant pseudomonas. Patient at 
risk for developing further antibiotic resistance given 
interrupted courses of levofloxacin and vanc/zosyn in the week 
prior to presentation. However, given clinical improvement, 
antibiotics were narrowed to piperacillin-tazobactam in 
consultation with ID with plan for 14 day total course with 
close outpatient follow up. Sputum culture this admission grew 
commensal respiratory flora and sparse yeast, which may 
represent exophiala species felt to represent colonization on 
prior BAL. Endobronchial coil removal was discussed with IP and 
ID, but deferred given clinical improvement on antibiotics. 

# COPD: Severe with FEV1 23% and reduced DLCO s/p endobronchial 
coiling as above. Normally on prednisone 10mg daily, recently on

CT Head ___
IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement or 
evidence of focal
or diffuse lesions. There is no evidence of intracranial 
hemorrhage, mass, or
mass effect. No metastasic lesions are visulized, however CT 
with contrast
is not able to provide the same anatomical detail comparable to 
MRI with and
without contrast.
.
PET CT: ___
MPRESSION: 1. Widespread metastatic disease. 2. Malignant soft 
tissue nodule
in the deep right breast is most likely a metastasis from lung 
cancer (given
second subcutaneous deposit in the anterior abdominal wall), but 
the possibility
of a second breast primary remains a remote consideration. 3. 
Suspicious
focus in the pancreas is also likely a metastasis, but again, a 
primary
malignancy would be difficult to entirely exclude.
.
ECHO: ___
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF 60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic 
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main 
pulmonary artery is dilated.
.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The 
effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right atrial as 
well as right ventricular free wall diastolic invagination. 
However, there is no major respirophasic variation of right or 
left ventriculart inflow. These findings suggest that increased 
pericardial pressure is present, without major impairment of 
ventricular filling or frank cardiac tamponade. Serial clinical 
and echocardiographic followup is recommended. 
.
ECHO ___:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small to 
moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears 
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. 
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
right ventricular diastolic invagination is appreciated. The 
pericardial effusion appears slightly smaller.
.
___:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism to the 
subsegmental
level.
2. Increased dense nonenhancing right lower lobe consolidation 
consistent
with pneumonia, with additional increased predominantly 
ground-glass
consolidation / post obstructive changes (due to right hilar 
mass /
adenopathy) within the posterior portion of the left upper lobe 
and adjacent
to the right pleural effusion, which are also presumably 
infectious in
etiology. Please note reexpansion edema involving a portion of 
the right lower
lobe may also have a similar appearance.
3. Increased enhancing atelectasis involving the left lower lobe 
with left
pleural fluid noted to insinuate around regions of ""drowned"" 
lung.
4. No significant interval change in the degree of previously 
described
adenopathy and a dominant right hilar mass, with stable mass 
effect on right
upper lobe and bronchus intermedius bronchi. Stable mass effect 
on the right
upper lobe pulmonary artery, which remains patent.
5. Unchanged soft tissue density within the deep right breast, 
which was
noted to be FDG-avid.
6. Unchanged background emphysema and interstitial septal 
thickening, which
is worrisome for lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
7. Stable lytic metastatic lesions and thickening of the left 
adrenal gland.

DIAGNOSED BY:
___, CT(___)
___, M.D.
 
(___)
.
___: TTE
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small to moderate 
sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears 
circumferential. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is 
seen. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There is 
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in 
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired 
ventricular filling. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the resting heart rate is faster and respiratory variation in 
mitral valve inflow is present (this may be secondary to other 
entities than impending tamponade such as volume depletion or 
lung disease). Left ventricular function is more vigorous. 
.
___: CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is 
increasing
consolidation and volume loss in the right upper lobe. The 
perihilar right
lung areas, notably neighboring a hilar mass, are denser than on 
the previous
examination. A pre-existing right-sided pleural effusion is 
unchanged, and
the expansion of the right lower lobe is slightly improved as 
compared to the
previous exam. No pathologic changes in the left lung.

episode of desaturation requiring up to 10L with CXR evidence of 
re-expansion pulmonary edema, this improved somewhat with 
diuresis, but CT chest ___ showed marked worsening of effusions 
& dense consolodate of RLL with ground glass opacities 
surrounding. A second thoarcenetsis was then performed which was 
complcated by a PTX after which a chest tube was placed for 24 
hrs without complication. The patient was placed on Levo/Flagyl

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an ___ year old female with PMH of moderate-to-severe 
COPD (on home 2L O2, no intubations/ICU stays) who presents from 
home with shortness of breath for 4 days. Patient was last in 
her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation 
when she developed insidious onset shortness of breath with 
cough. She had no fevers or chills and noted increased chest 
congestion but is unable to expectorate. She presented to her 
PCP's office 2 days PTA when she was prescribed prednisone and a 
z-pak. Then on the day prior to this admission she presented to 
the ___ ED for persistant SOB nad weakness. She was unable to 
eat large quantities because of the shortness of breath. In the 
ED she was treated with albuterol nebs and was discharged after 
performing well on a walk test around the ED. Then, on the day 
of presentation, patient's shortness of breath again became 
suddenly worse. She was speaking in short sentences and 
activities such as walking across the room or going to the 
bathroom caused her severe dyspnea. She called the ambulance and 
was taken back to the ED.
.  
In the ED, initial vital signs were T95.6, HR98, BP175/96, RR28, 
O2sat99% 2L nasal prongs. Exam was significant for initially 
speaking in 2 word sentences, and poor air entry b/l with no 
wheezes/crackles. This improved with nebulizers and she was able 
to speak in full sentences. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no 
acute ST-t wave changes. Troponin was <0.01. WBC count was 
normal, and patient received prednisone 60mg, ipratropium and 
albuterol nebs, and azithromycin 250mg. She had an episode of 
desaturation to 86% on nebs and was placed on NIPPV (FiO2: 100 
PEEP: 5 PS: 10) with improvement of sats up to 96%. Unable to 
tolerate further bipap she was placed on 5LNC with O2sats 96%. 
She received 1mg of IV ativan for anxiety. Vital signs prior to 
transfer were T97.9 HR103 BP177/87 RR28 O2sat95% 5LNC.  
. 
On arrival to the MICU, intial VS were T98.1, HR99, BP152/90, 
RR29, O2sat94% 5LNC. She reports improvement in her SOB. She 
reports being hungry. She endorses a slight headache. She 
reports having some loose stool that corresponds to when she 
started azithromycin as an outpatient.

IMAGING:
___ PA/LAT/OBLIQUE CXR: The heart is normal in size. The 
mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The aortic arch 
is calcified. Central pulmonary arteries are again prominent. 
The chest is hyperinflated. Bronchovascular markings are 
attenuated and irregular, particularly in the upper lungs, 
suggesting obstructive pulmonary disease. A hiatal hernia is 
probably small-to-moderate in size. No focal opacity is 
identified. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild 
degenerative changes are similar along the lower thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. No evidence of pneumonia. Small-to-moderate hiatal 
hernia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with PMH of moderate-to-severe COPD (FEV1 37% 
of predicted ___ on home O2 for exertion, who presented with 
SOB secondary to a COPD exacerbation. 
. 
ACTIVE ISSUES: 
# COPD exacerbation: Patient has moderate-severe COPD on 2LNC 
home oxygen only with exertion, otherwise on room air. She 
presented with 3 days of increasing shortness of breath 
improving with bronchodilators and at one point requiring NIPPV 
in the ED. She had a significant component of anxiety while in 
the ED, exacerbating the tachypnea in addition to her COPD 
flare, which has been the case in prior exacerbations as well 
per discussion with her PCP. Overnight in the ICU she was easily 
weaned to 91% oxygen on room air and was able to be transferred 
to the medical floor. Although there was no evidence of 
pneumonia on her CXR, she was continued on the azithromycin 
which had been started by her PCP and completed ___ 5-day course. 
She was also started on prednisone 60mg daily with plan for a 
slow taper. Her Advair, Spiriva, and albuterol were continued 
and she was treated with lorazepam prn for anxiety with good 
effect. Upon discharge she was breathing comfortably with O2 
sats in the mid-90s on 1L NC and was ambulating. She is 
currently on prednisone 50mg daily with plan to taper as 
follows: 40mg (___), 30mg (___), 20mg (___), 
10mg (___), and then stop. She will have outpatient 
pulmonary rehab and has f/u appointments scheduled with her PCP 
and pulmonologist.   
.
# Hypertension: Patient's blood pressure was persistent elevated 
in the 150s-160s with several readings in the 170s. She denies a 
history of HTN and after discussing this with her PCP ___. 
___ may be a component of white coat hypertension 
and anxiety. We elected not to treat it at this time. She has a 
f/u appointment with Dr. ___ at which time he will recheck 
her BP and decide whether to start an antihypertensive agent.  
.
# UTI: Patient developed a mild leukocytosis (WBC 11.9) on the 
day of discharge. She has been afebrile but UA revealed a UTI. 
She states that she has a history of recurrent UTIs and has a 
prescription for ciprofloxacin 250mg at home which is not 
expired. She wishes to take her own medication at home and 
states that she will take 1 pill BID for the next 3 days. She 
understands warning signs that should prompt her to seek medical 
attention such as worsening abdominal pain, flank pain, or 
fevers. The urine culture is pending at the time of discharge. I 
will follow this up and contact the patient and her PCP should 
the organism return resistant to ciprofloxacin.   
.
INACTIVE ISSUES: 
# Osteopenia: Continued Vitamin D supplementation.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
# Opacity on CXR: Patient had a small opacity in the 
costophrenic recess on the lateral view CXR. Unclear etiology 
but stable since ___. Radiology recommends non-emergent CT scan 
to evaluate. The patient is aware of this.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
Overnight on POD#0, the patient was given a 500 mL bolus for low 
urine output.  She was unable to void and had to be straight 
cath'ed x1.  After that, she was able to void independently 
thereafter. On POD 3, patient became acutely delirious. EKG 
demonstrated Afib with Rvr. Rate was controlled with metoprolol. 
Medicine was consulted who recommended continuing the metoprolol 
for rate control. CXR and KUB were obtained. U/A were obtained. 
Imaging did not demonstrate acute findings other than 
atelectasis. Troponins negative. On POD#4 she became agitated 
and the patient's family was contacted to assist. On POD#5 
patient was noted to have leukocytosis with WBC 12.0 and urinary 
frequency with discomfort, u/a was consistent with infection, 
she was started on Ciprofloxacin for 7 days. Upon discharge her 
mental status was clear, alert, oriented, and cooperative. 

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing was changed and the Silverlon dressing was removed on 
POD#2. The surgical incision was found to be clean and intact 
without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen 
daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the 
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions. 
Walker or two crutches at all times for 6 weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ under the care of Dr. 
___. He underwent ___ angiogram on ___ that showed occlusion 
of the superficial femoral artery with
reconstitution in the above-knee popliteal artery and 2-vessel 
runoff to the foot.  Given these findings, the operation was 
terminated at that point with a plan for surgical bypass at a 
later point. The following day he underwent a mesenteric 
angiogram via brachial approcah. He underwent balloon 
angioplasty of iliac artery stenosis and balloon angioplasty of 
SMA stenosis. Post-operatively he recovered well. He continued 
to have generalized abdominal pain and a GI consult was 
obtained. Since he had evidence of gastritis and duodenal ulcers 
in ___ on EGD, and since he
is unsure if he took PPI since then, the gastroenterologists 
felt that remaining ulcers may also be contributing to the 
abdominal pain. They recommended increasing PPI to 40 mg PO BID 
for 2 weeks, avoiding NSAIDs and will consider repeat EGD as 
outpatient if no improvement. He was discharged home on ___ 
tolerating a regular diet but with similar abdominal complaints 
as prior.

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: This is a ___ YO M CAD, chronic, 
likely diastolic CHF who is representing to the ED after 
presenting with diaphoresis, nausea, presyncope at rehab.  After 
being recently discharged from ___, while at rehab, he was 
sitting in his wheelchair when he developed diaphoresis at rest. 
 He did have a bowel movement about half hour prior to event.  
Diaphoresis was associated with nausea and feeling of confusion. 
 Experienced chest palpitations.  Unclear if Mr ___ lost 
consciousness; denies any loss of stool or urine.  Discomfort 
lasted about 10 minutes and then resolved; has not recurred. 
Most recently he was admitted to the hospital on ___

right precordial lead T wave changes appear less prominent but 
there may be no significant change. 
.
Abd/pelvis CT:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large conglomerate retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy along with 
bilateral 
common and external iliac lymphadenopathy with mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy and right hilar lymphadenopathy raise concern 
for the lymphoma. 
2. Bilateral ground-glass opacity, increased interstitial 
markings in the 
right lung and micronodular lesions bilaterally, also concerning 
for 
lymphangitic spread. 
3. 4.7 cm lesion in the interpolar region of the right kidney 
likely also 
represents lymphoma. (please note that the pattern of lymph 
adenopathy is 
unusual for metastases from renal cell carcinoma) 
4. Spleen is elongated, measuring 16.9 cm. 
.
ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic 
function. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.  
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Fevers/Neoplastic Process: Differential initially broad 
encompassing hospital acquired pneumonia versus neoplastic 
process.  A subacute neoplastic process is more likely given 
several weeks-months of night sweats, malaise, and fevers with 
finding of extensive retroperitoneal and mediastinal adenopathy 
on CT.  Other possibly pertinent symptoms include note of 
intermittent hematuria, intermittent abdominal discomfort.  
Other laboratory findings of note: anemia, microscopic 
hematuria, ESR > 100, CRP > upper limit of assay.  Preliminary 
staining is suggestive of a carcinoma given findings of 
organizing tubular structures seen on microscopy.  The type of 
carcinoma is still under review but some stains are suggestive 
of renal cell carcinoma.  CT suggests there is a renal nodule 
that is less likely to be renal cell. At this point, we have 
told Mr ___ that the culmination of our studies so far suggest 
that he likely has an underlying carcinoma leading to his 
constellation of symptoms, however this is not definitive, and 
if it is a carcinoma, we don't yet have a finalized primary 
source.  According to pathology, it should take an additional 
week or so before the pathology report is finalized.  He was set 
up for a primary care appointment with me on ___, and I emphasized the importance of follow-up.  
.
While he was in the hospital, we also evaluated other sources of 
fever.  A chest x-ray revealed a multifocal pneumonia.  Given 
his recent hospitalization, we treated this as a hospital 
acquired pneumonia with an 8 day course of vancomycin and 
cefepime and covered him with azithromycin for a 7 day course 
for the possibility of atypicals.  His cough slowly improved 
over the course of his hospitalization and his fevers trended 
down.  He did not have any leukocytosis during the course of his 
hospitalization.  At time of discharge, he was afebrile for > 48 
hours and his antibiotics course was complete. 
.
2) Atrial fibrillation: Was found to be in new onset atrial 
fibrillation in ED.  Unclear what precipitant of afib could be; 
could be secondary to recent pneumonia/infection. Also has 
significant mediastinal adenopathy; could represent infiltrative 
or compressive process creating an irritant focus.  Had no RVR; 
rates were 70 - 80.  CHADS score was +3.  Coumadin was started 
with goal INR near 2.  Carvedilol was continued at dose of 12.5 
mg BID.  He was discharged and set up with ___ 
clinic. He was discharged with a ___ mg alternating dose 
coumadin regimen.
.
3) Acute on Chronic renal failure: Creatinine was initially 
elevated on presentation, however her electrolytes were 
consistent with prerenal disease.  Following administration of 
fluids, his creatinine resolved to below her baseline. 
.
4) Coronary artery disease:  Troponin levels were checked on 
admission and were negative.  He was continued on his statin, 
aspirin, beta blocker and Ace inhibitor.  His lisinopril was 
held as this tended to precipitously decrease his blood pressure 
< 80 systolic.  At time of discharge, his lisinopril continued 
to be held.
.
5) Congestive heart failure: There was no evidence for fluid 
overload; there were no rales on lung exam.  His JVP was not 
elevated.  He has unilateral 1+ left lower extremity edema; he 
was continued on lasix 80 mg daily.  
.
6) Left ankle pain: Differential is gout vs trauma from recent 
fall.  Mild inflammatory changes seen along left foot (erythema, 
decreased range of motion, mildly warm).  Started on colchicine 
with improvement in symptoms.  Has crystal proven gout last year 
after left ankle joint was tapped.  Was discharged with a 3 day 
continued supply of colchicine.   
.
7) Dispo:  Was discharged to assisted living facility after 
cleared by physical therapy.  Appointments were set up with 
primary care and is being followed by ___ clinic.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were at ___ 
___.  As you know, the result of some of our studies are 
concerning for a cancer diagnosis, however we do not yet have 
enough information to suggest what kind of cancer you may have.  
In the coming weeks, these results should become clearer, and 
this will help us to develop a plan.  You are not alone in this 
challenge; there will be several doctors who ___ be 
participating in your care.  The most important things for you 
will be to keep your mind and body as healthy as you can so that 
you can put your best foot forward.  You will be followed by me 
in primary care so that I can coordinate all of your care in the 
coming months.  Following up with all of your appointments is 
one of your most important priorities.
.
I've explained some of the important points of your 
hospitalization at ___ below:
(1) When you came into the hospital, you had symptoms of fevers, 
cough, and night sweats.  A lot of these symptoms could be 
because of the possibility of cancer.  However, when we did a 
chest x-ray, we found that you also had a pneumonia in your 
lungs.  This could explain some of your symptoms.  We started 
you on antibiotics for 8 days which led to improvement in your 
cough and fevers.  
(2) While you were hospitalized we found that your heart was 
beating irregularly in a rhythm that we call atrial 
fibrillation.  This can happen when you have an underlying 
infection like pneumonia.  Sometimes this heart rhythm can lead 
to formations of a clot in your heart which can increase your 
risk of stroke.  To help treat this, we started you on a 
medicine called coumadin, which helps to thin the blood.  This 
medicine will require frequent monitoring of your labs and your 
assisted living facility will help draw these.  It is important 
that you take this medicine daily as directed to ensure that you 
do not develop a clot.
(3) While you were here you also developed pain in your left 
foot that we felt was consistent with gout.  We started you on 
colchicine which helped your pain and also increased your pain 
medicine.  You will have enough colchicine for another three 
days to continue to treat your gout.  
.
We made the following medication changes to your usual meds that 
are summarized below:
(1) You should take coumadin (the blood thinner) 5 mg every 
___ and ___, and 2.5mg on ___, 
___ and ___. This dose may be adjusted after we check 
your blood. The ___ lab will be checking your 
blood at your assisted living facility on ___. 
From then on you will get labs checked every week so that your 
dose can be adjusted appropriately.
(2) You should stop taking lisinopril, a blood pressure medicine 
that was decreasing your blood pressure too much.  You can 
restart this as an outpatient as directed by your outpatient 
team.
(3) You should take colchicine 0.6 mg daily for another 3 days 
after you leave the hospital.
(4) You should take oxycodone 10 mg as needed every six hours 
for pain.  
(5) You can use your albuterol inhaler ___ puffs as needed for 
wheezing and shortness of breath.
(6) You can take maalox as needed for your stomach pain.
.
If you experience worsening fevers, diaphoresis, vomiting, 
worsening cough, worsening blood in your urine, or any other 
concerning symptoms, please let your primary care doctor know or 
return to the emergency department.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Bright red blood per rectum- Evidence of pancolitis on initial 
CT, stool studies significant for c diff colitis.  Bleeding 
stopped once INR was corrected.  GI was consulted and suggest a 
colonoscopy in about 4 weeks, after colitis has had time to 
improve.  Follow up scheduled with GI, ___ to check INR and hct 
3 times per week.  
.
# C Difficile colitis: Diarrhea improved on Flagyl, planned 14 
day course.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Coumadin restarted prior to discharge 
without GI bleed.  She was discharged on approx ___ the dose of 
coumadin she was on prior to admission.  ___ to check INR 3 
times per week.  Nutritionist saw pt to eduated re: food 
restrictions while on coumadin.
.
# Falls/imbalance- Patient had a fall while in the ___ ICU 
overnight, and hit her head (likely on an open cabinet door 
adjacent to the toilet), requiring 3 stitches for a laceration. 
A CT head was obtained immediately after and showed no acute 
hemorrhage. There had been no significant events on telemetry 
and no indication of pacemaker malfunction. A CT spine was 
obtained and the read showed no fracture, and her C-spine was 
cleared. Approximately 12 hours later, a nurse observed the 
patient to be extremely unsteady on her feet, somewhat 
tremulous, and not as easily conversant as prior. A second CT 
head was obtained and was negative for edema or new subdural. 
The patient was observed overnight on fall precautions and there 
were no further events, and her mental status was at baseline. 
The attending radiologist later re-read the C-spine study and 
notified the team that there was possible cervical cord 
compression.
.
# Cervical Cord compression w/o radiculopathy: Possible C6-C7 
cord compression based on CT cervical spine. No associated 
neurologic deficits. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended 
myelogram for further assessment. The family and patient chose 
not to have the CT myelogram done.  They stated that they would 
never opt for surgery, and if that was the only recommendation 
to come out of CT myelogram, they felt there was no use for the 
study.  Neurosurgery team confirmed this was in fact the case.  
Family is aware that if symptoms develop, falls increase from 
weakness, or any other concerns for symptomatic cord 
compression, and they should see PCP immediately to discuss CT 
myelogram and possible decompressive surgery.
.
#CKD, stage III: Pt in ARF at admission, resolved to baseline 
creatinine of 1.3
.
#Chronic systolic heart failure: Past EF 20% per family, however 
recent echo in ___ with EF > 60%.  Pt was continued on 
isosorbide, metoprolol, lasix.  Lisinopril was held as pt 
noticed that she had a chronic cough that had resolved during 
the hospitalization while off of Lisinopril.  Plan is to hold

CXR: In comparison with study of ___, there is little change and 
no
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  There is a streak of 
fibrosis or
atelectasis again in the left mid zone.  Otherwise, no 
pneumonia, vascular
congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of COPD, HTN, depression, fibromyalgia with 
recent hospitalization for COPD flare who presents with acute 
SOB and wheezing on exam consistent with recurrent COPD flare.

# COPD with acute exacerbation: She appeared euvolemic with no 
suspected CHF, normal TTE in ___. Positive URI symptoms 
likely triggered flare. Of note, pt was supposed to follow up 
with pulmonology for PFTs but had to reschedule. She was started 
on a prednisone taper and a 3 day course of levaquin. Her 
symptoms improved dramatically. She was discharged on flovent 
instead of budesonide. Her home COPD medications were otherwise 
unchanged. 

# Hypokalemia: Etiology likely secondary to diuretic and/or 
frequent administration of albuterol. She normally takes 20meq 
KCl daily at home. HCTZ was held, and K improved. Blood 
pressures remained well controlled. Recommend uptitrating 
lisinopril as needed. 

Chronic issues:
# Anemia: Hct at baseline. History of normal iron studies. 
# HTN: held HCTZ and continued lisinopril as above.
# Fibromyalgia: continued home gabapentin and ibuprofen
# Depression: continued home zoloft. SW consult.
# PACT patient: PACT aware of admission, following.

Transitional issues:
# HCTZ discontinued; can uptitrate lisinopril as needed.

IMAGING:
.
CXR (___): 
Lung volumes are low resulting in vascular crowding. Minimally 
increased interstitial markings, predominantly at the lung bases 
may indicate an underlying interstitial abnormality. There is no 
consolidation or pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The 
heart size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. 
There is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement. Pulmonary 
vascularity is normal. Degenerative changes and ossification of 
the anterior longitudinal ligament are noted in the spine. 
IMPRESSIONS: No consolidation. No hilar enlargement. 
.
EKG (___): Normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, Right 
bundle branch block with ? left anterior fascicular block. No 
obvious ischemic changes.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old female with chronic anemia who presents 
with 1 month of fatigue and found to have worsening anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and ARF.  
.  
# Hypotension:  Pt presented to PCP ___ ___ with BP 78/60, but 
BP has been stable and within normal limits since admission to 
___.  Hypotension was potentially hypovolemic in nature, 
although patient did not require fluids for resolution of low 
BP.  The patient's orthostatics were negative during this 
admission; an outpatient workup for orthostatic hypotension may 
be worth considering, although the patient does not have a 
history of falls and is otherwise asymptomatic.
.
# Anemia - Multiple possible causes, including aplastic anemia, 
myelodysplastic syndrome, anemia of chronic disease, plasma cell 
dyscrasias, blood loss, or hemolytic process.  Symptoms suggest 
a relatively chronic process but HCT dropped from 23->21 in 12 
hours on ___, suggesting a possibly accelerating process. 
Possible slow GI bleed but less likely given guaiac negative and 
constipation.  Hemolysis labs reportedly negative overnight, but 
re-sent because could not find in system.  DIC very unlikely 
given elevated fibrinogen, normal D-dimer, and normal coags.  
Concern for TTP-HUS with anemia, thrombocytopenia, low grade 
fever and ARF but no schistocytes seen on smear and again, no 
evidence of hemolysis (elevated TBili on ___ likely 
post-transfusional).  All cell lines down so possible marrow 
process affecting production, especially with slight lymphocytic 
predominance and atypicals on smear.  Previous Fe studies and 
B12/folate normal.  Previous renal function normal and anemia is 
normocytic, so anemia of chronic disease less likely.  SPEP 
normal in ___, resent to r/o plasma cell dyscrasia.  No 
chemotherapy, radiation exposure, or medications suggestive of 
aplastic anemia.  MDS is ___ strong possibility given her age, 
pancytopenia, low reticulocyte count.
.
Two peripheral IVs (18-gauge) were placed and 2 units PRBCs 
given on ___, with an improvement in Hct to from 
20.8->24.3->29.0 on ___.  Reticulocyte count was found to be 
low at 0.9.  Iron studies did not suggest iron deficiency anemia 
or B12/folate deficiency, although we will continue the 
patient's outpatient iron supplementation regimen.  A peripheral 
smear and SPEP/UPEP were sent and were pending at discharge.  
Hematology-oncology saw the patient, agrees with our 
differential of myelodysplastic syndrome vs. myelofibrosis and 
recommended follow up in clinic for possible consideration of BM 
biopsy which could provide definitive diagnosis, though the 
extent that this would change management in this ___ year old 
woman is unclear.
.  
# Thrombocytopenia: Similar concerns as above.  DIC and TTP were 
thought to be unlikely in the absence of evidence for hemolysis. 
 There is a possible production problem as noted above. Could be 
ITP but that is a diagnosis of exclusion, and less likely given 
the patient's pancytopenia.   
.  
# ARF: Pt had a mild elevation in creatinine to 1.3 (baseline 
1.0) on admission, which resolved with transfusion and 
hydration.  Likely related to anemia and relative hypovolemia. 
BUN/Cr<20, suggestive of mild prerenal process.  Receiving 2 
units of blood which should be a good volume challenge.  
Creatinine improved with transfusion to 1.0 on ___.
.  
# Fever: Low grade temp to 100.4 in triage. No clear localizing 
source. Will hold on abx unless decompensates.  CXR was negative 
for consolidation, exam does show some dry crackles most likely 
due to atalectasis.  Urinalysis was negative in detail, and 
urine and blood cultures remain pending.
.  
# Osteoporosis: Reports not taking her fosamax due to concerns 
about not being able to sit up long enough.  Will hold for now.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for weakness and fatigue and were found to 
have a low red blood cell count (anemia).  You were given a 
blood transfusion and your symptoms improved.  You were found to 
have low platelets (thrombocytopenia) and white blood cell count 
(leukopenia).  You were seen by the hematology-oncology team and 
they felt the low cell lines may be due to a process of abnormal 
blood cell proliferation or other cause of hindrance in the bone 
marrow (myelodysplastic syndrome or myelofibrosis).  

No changes were made to your medication regimen.  Please take 
all of your home medications as prescribed.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ woman with a past medical history 
significant for HTN, T2DM, seizure disorder, Hepatitis C, and 
schizoaffective disorder who presents with 10 days of R groin 
pain.

At baseline, she uses a walker to ambulate and takes Oxycodone 
for diabetic neuropathy, which she describes a ""burning"" 
sensation in her BLE. She was in her usual state of health until 
2 weeks ago when she slipped on a banana peel and ended up in a 
splits position. 2 days later, she noted R groin pain. On ___, 
she was admitted to ___ with acute urinary retention likely 
___ Oxycodone/Benadryl use and UTI and RLQ abdominal pain. Her 
Benadryl was temporarily D/C'ed, and she was treated with a 
course of Macrobid. In terms of her RLQ abdominal pain, acute 
processes were ruled-out via CT and U/S. She reports that her 
pain, which she clarifies was always R groin and not RLQ, 
slightly improved on D/C, but has gradually worsened since then. 
She describes this pain as non-radiating, pulsating pain that is 
constant; exacerbated with movement; and accompanied by shooting 
pains down her RLE. She endorses fevers (Tm 100.4) and chills, 
but denies N/V, abdominal pain, changes in her bowel habits, or 
urinary symptoms.

In the ED, her initial vitals were T 99.8 HR 96 BP 144/77 RR 18 
SaO2 97% on RA. Her physical examination was notable for R 
inguinal TTP. Her laboratory results were notable for Na 131; 
ALT 51 AST 87 Alk Phos 199 Tbili 1.7 Alb 3.0; and WBC 8.1. She 
underwent RUQ U/S which was unchanged. She received IV Morphine 
17 MG for pain. 

Currently, she continues to report R groin pain and is 
requesting pain medications. Otherwise, she has no additional 
complaints.

IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

___ RUQ U/S:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Nodular and coarsened liver compatible with cirrhosis without 
focal lesions. 
2. Splenomegaly. 
3. No evidence of cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis.

___ Hip XR:
FINDINGS: Bony structures and joint spaces are essentially 
within normal limits and symmetric bilaterally. No evidence of 
fracture or dislocation. However, if there is strong clinical 
concern for an occult fracture, cross-sectional imaging should 
be obtained.

___ MR-L spine:
IMPRESSION: 
Multilevel disc disease most notably at the L4-L5 level where 
there is a right paracentral disc bulge with superimposed disc 
extrusion extending superiorly into the right lateral recess.  
This disc causes mass effect on the exiting right L4 nerve root 
and traversing right L5 nerve root.

___ MR-Hip (Prelim):
IMPRESSION: 
MR of the hip demonstrating extensive edema of multiple muscles 
around the pelvic girdle, predominantly involving obturator 
internus, externus, quadratus femoris and gluteus medius. This 
is centered around the superior pubic ramus which demonstrates 
mild bone edema but no fracture. Differentials for this 
appearance include myositis, infection, lymphoma. Recommend 
contrast enhanced MRI to further evaluate.

___ MR-Hip with contrast:
IMPRESSION: 
The area of diffuse muscular and bone marrow edema enhances 
avidly. The lack of any fluid collection or heterogenous 
enhancement makes infection somewhat less likely, however 
differential considerations also include tumor and 
post-traumatic changes.   
  
Additional history was provided confirming recent trauma. Given 
this additional information, post-traumatic change is the most 
likely of the provided differentials. Follow-up with repeat MRI 
in ___ weeks to ensure improvement/resolution is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
#R groin pain: The patient presented with R groin pain in the 
setting of a fall. Her pain was likely ___ musculoskeletal 
strain in the setting of trauma. However, given her low-grade 
fevers and elevated inflammatory markers, septic joint was 
considered. Her WBC was WNL, and her Hip-XR were unremarkable. 
Her MR-Hip with and without contrast were consistent with 
post-traumatic changes. Initially, there was concern for 
lymphoma. However, her laboratory values were only notable for a 
slightly elevated LDH (her baseline) and significantly elevated 
ESR and CRP. She was given PO Oxycodone for pain in addition to 
her home Sulindac, and she was discharged on a limited supply of 
PO Oxycodone. ___ evaluated her and felt that she was safe to 
return home with ___. Follow-up with repeat MRI in ___ weeks to

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old woman admitted with chest pain and shortness of 
breath with evidence of possible PNA on CXR. The patient 
received Vancomycin and Levaquin in the ED for possible 
pneumonia and Lasix 10mg IV for possible congestive heart 
failure. During her hospital course, her presentation was less 
consistent with congestive heart failure, furthermore she does 
not have a history of heart failure. She was ruled out for 
cardiac ischemia or arrythmia. Her symptoms are thought to be 
related to mild pneumonia versus bronchitis. Throughout her stay 
her vital signs were stable and she never required supplemental 
oxygen. We increased her long acting Isosorbide mononitrate to 
60 mg daily for better blood pressure control. She will need to 
finish a 7 day course of Levofloxacin. She was seen by 
cardiology in consultation, who felt that her chest pain may be 
cardiac, but they recommended medical management at present (in 
the absence of elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes) with 
potential additional diagnostics (e.g. stress test) to be 
pursued as an outpatient. She will need follow up with 
cardiology, and a new echocardiogram. Both of these should be 
scheduled by the rehab facility, as we could not make these 
appointments over the weekend.  

Her daytime blood sugars were high on multiple occasions. She 
may benefit from oral anti-diabetic regiment, which could be 
considered as outpatient. All her other chronic medical problems 
were stable, and required no change in her treatment plan.  

During this hospitalization she expressed the wish to be 
DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is ___ male with history of severe Alzheimer's, 
previously on hospice who presented with respiratory failure 
requiring urgent intubation. The patient's family was present 
for goals of care discussion, and it was ultimately decided to 
transition to comfort-focused care with hospice.

ACUTE PROBLEMS:
===============
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure
The patient was brought in from home with increasing somnolence, 
cough, and labored breathing. He was hypoxemic to the ___ on 
arrival to the emergency room. He was started on IV vancomycin 
and cefepime. CXR suggested aspiration pneumonia. He was 
intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. The ICU 
team discussed goals of care with the patient's family, who 
decided that the patient would not want to be on a ventilator. 
He was extubated and transferred to the general floor for 
comfort care. Subsequent respiratory distress was management 
with IV morphine gtt and then SL liquid morphine.

# Hypovolemic hypernatremia
Patient was given IV fluids with subsequent improvement.

# Myoclonus
# Encephalopathy
Patient has dementia and is non-verbal at baseline, with acutely 
worsened mental status in setting of infection. He was found to 
have clonus of the extremities. Head CT and CT-spine were 
unremarkable. There was low concern for seizures per neurology. 

# Goals of care
The patient was previously on hospice prior to this admission. 
Due to respiratory failure, the family decided to change the 
patient's code status to DNR/DNI, comfort care, with plan for 
home hospice. The patient was maintained on oral morphine and 
Ativan for comfort. 

========================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
========================
[ ] Patient is discharged to home hospice with scripts for 
morphine and Ativan as needed for comfort.

[x] The patient is safe to discharge today, and I spent [x] 
<30min; [ ] >30min in discharge day management services.

STUDIES:
___ (outpatient) STRESS TEST
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with a history of HTN, gout 
and 
HL was referred to the lab for evalution of chest discomfort. 
The 
patient exercised for 11 minutes of ___ protocol and stopped 
for 
fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 11.9 which 
represents an 
excellent functional capacity for his age. Near peak exercise, 
the 
patient noted a non-progressive right sided chest discomfort. 
This 
resolved with rest by minute 2 of recovery. At peak exercise, 
there was 
1-1.5 mm horizontal ST segment depression in the inferolateral 
leads. 
This became downsloping in recovery and resovled with rest by 
minute 7. 
the rhythm was sinus with rare isolated apbs during exercise and 

frequent isolated vpbs in recovery. Resting HTN with an 
appropriate 
increase in systolic BP with exercise and slight blunting or HR 
on beta 
blocker therapy. 
IMPRESSION: Ischemic EKG changes with atypical chest discomfort. 

Nuclear report sent separately. 

___ EKG
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 
56 0 92 420/413 0 -3 55 
Sinus bradycardia. Baseline artifact. Initial deflections in 
leads III and aVF likely preclude prior inferior wall myocardial 
infarction, as reported on ___. No diagnostic interim 
change. Ventricular ectopy is absent. 

___ CARDIAC PERFUSION
IMPRESSION: 
1. Reversible, large, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the LCx territory. 
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 
Compared with the study of ___, the defect is new. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:   
The lungs remain clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
within normal 
limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic 
arch. No acute osseous abnormalities identified. 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ CARDIAC CATH
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA:  20% minor irregularities
LAD:   The LAD was heavily calcified with diffuse disease.  
There was a large diagonal branch with a 80-90% stenosis at its
origin.   Three was a large second diagonal branch with an 
60-70%
stenosis at its origin.   There was an 80% stenosis in the mid
LAD and diffusely 80-90% stenosis in the mid LAD.  The distal 
LAD
had minor lumen irregularities. 
LCX:  The LCX was a small vessel with an occlusion of the OMB.
RCA: The RCA was a large dominant vessel.  It had a 50% stenosis
in the distal RCA.  There was diffuse 60-70% disease throughout
the PLSA.  There was a 90% stenosis in RPL2 . There were right 
to
left collaterals to the OMB.
ASSESSMENT
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease

___ CARDIAC ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function 
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular systolic function. Mildly 
dilated ascending aorta. Mild mitral regurgitation. Normal 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images unavailable for review) of 
___, the findings are similar.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with HTN, DM,HL, CAD and b/l hearing 
loss presenting with new onset exertional angina abnormal stress 
test who was found to have three vessel CAD.

# Unstable Angina/CAD: Mr. ___ had been experiencing progressive 
exertional, substernal chest pain and was sent for outpatient 
studies by his neurologist. He had an abnormal stress test and 
perfusion study showing a large reversible moderate severity 
perfusion defect involving the Lcx territory, so he was sent to 
the ER, where troponin was <0.01 and his EKG showed no ST 
segment elevations. He was admitted and underwent a cardiac 
catheterization that showed three vessel CAD.  He was then seen 
by cardiac surgery for evaluation of cardiac ___ bypass graft 
surgery.  This was scheduled for ___, after a 5 day 
plavix wash-out period.  He was discharged with chlorhexidine 
washes for ___ night and ___ morning, as well as 
mupirocen nasal cream BID, and the time and place to present for 
admission on ___ morning.  He was also set up for ___ as he 
expressed concern about being able to complete his pre-op 
regimen and take his medication as prescribed.  His Lisinopril 
was held from discharge until after surgery as he had a mild 
increase in creatinine.  His plavix was held.  His home atenoll 
was converted to metoprolol and aspirin was started; these 
medications were continued until surgery. His atorvastatin dose 
was increased to 80mg daily, which was also continued.

# Travel plasn:  A medical note was provided as he was no longer 
able to travel as anticipated.

Cardiac cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system 
revealed 
three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was calcified 
with 
minimal disease.  The LAD had moderate disease, an ostial 90% 
stenosis 
at the diagonal artery near the ostium.  The LCX had an 80% 
stenosis at 
the mid segment.  The RCA was non dominant with diffuse high 
grade 
disease. 
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated LV filling 
pressures, 
moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, and a low cardiac index 
(1.9). 
3. Stenting of mid LCX with Xience 3x8

Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH EtOH cirrhosis, s/p combo liver/kidney trx (___) 
c/bbiliary strict and chronic rejection requiring 
___, recently hospitalized for PNA, was 
readmitted for incision wound infection. Wound was I&D'd in the 
ED and he was admitted to transplant surgery where he was 
started on broad spectrum antibiotics pending blood and 
incision/wound cultures. The wound was packed with Iodiform. 

Wound culture initially isolated 2+ GPRs. He was afebrile and 
would improved. Final culture data was unable until after 
patient discharged on Augmentin to complete a weeks course. 
Wound measured 2cm x 1cm. Normal saline damp to dry dressings 
were to be done bid. Blood cultures drawn were unfinalized, but 
negative to date. Of note, after patient was discharged, his 
wound culture was finalized as VRE. The plan was to switch to 
Linezolid for 7 days. His outpatient coordinator was notified 
and was to call in the Linezolid to pharmacy and call the 
patient. 

While in patient, nutrition recommended tube feeds for poor po 
intake. A post pyloric feeding tube was placed and tube feeds 
were started (Nepro). ___ provided teaching to the patient and 
his wife on ___ and supplies were delivered to the patient. 

Vital signs remained stable, LFTs improved some more. At time of 
discharge to home, his immunosuppression was set as tacrolimus 
3mg twice daily as his tacrolimus level was not back. Tacrolimus 
level was inaccurately reported and it was felt that the level 
reported was his roommate's and vice versa. So, his dose was 
increased to 3.5mg twice daily for a presumed level of 6.9 which 
was on the low side and was more consistent with the prior day 
of 8.1. Also, fluconazole was renally dosed and decreased to 
200mg daily to start ___. Next lab draw was set for ___. 

___ services were arranged in addition to ___. He was 
discharged to home appearing alert and in NAD.

PREBYPASS 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global 
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___ %). The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate impairment 
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending 
aorta is moderately dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is 
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe 
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate to 
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. 
POSTBYPASS
The patient is receiving dobutamine at 7ucg/kg/min.
RV systolic function is improved. There is now mild RV 
hypokinesis with minimal focality. LV systolic function is 
marginally improved, LVEF ~25%. There is a well seated, well 
fumctioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. There is a 
mild perivalvular leak. TR is now mild (1+). The remaining study 
is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for a cardiac 
catheterization in anticipation of his aortic valve surgery. His 
cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel coronary artery 
disease. Mr. ___ was worked-up in the usual preoperative 
manner and was ready for surgery. 

On ___ he was taken to the Operating Room where he 
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels and an 
aortic valve replacement using a tissue prosthesis. (Please see 
operative note for details.) He weaned from bypass on 
Dobutamine,Propofol and Neosynephrine in stable condition. 
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for 
monitoring. 

Over the next ___ hours he had awoke neurologically intact and 
was extubated. Pressors were weaned off and he remained stable. 
Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed. On postoperative day 
one, he was transferred to the step down unit for further 
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative 
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for 
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. 
Oxygenation remained low and a CXR revealed what appeared to be 
a large left effusion. A left lung thoracentesis was performed 
on ___ yielding 500 mL of serosanguinous fluid.  A repeat CXR 
demonstrated an elevated left diaphragm with atelectasis and 
resolution of the effusion.  His oxygenation improved and he 
felt better.

He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further 
recovery prior to going home.  He will continue on diuretics for 
a week as he remained above his preoperative weight.  
Arrangements were made for follow up with his cardiology, 
medical and surgical providers.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

___ were admitted to ___ and 
underwent an exploratory laparotomy, resection of
hepatic flexure, and right colostomy. ___ are recovering well 
and are now ready for discharge. Please follow the instructions 
below to continue your recovery:

Monitoring Ostomy output/ Prevention of Dehydration:
*Keep well hydrated.
*Replace fluid loss from ostomy daily.
*Avoid only drinking plain water. Include Gatorade and/or other 
vitamin drinks to replace fluid.
*Try to maintain ostomy output between 1000mL to 1500mL per day. 

*If Ostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with 
each episode of loose stool. Do not exceed 16mg/24 hours.

OSTOMY DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:

Patient D/C instructions:
 
___ have a new colostomy. The most common complication from a 
new colostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the 
stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is 
very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large 
intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed 
into the body and the stool becomes formed. ___ must measure 
your colostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from 
the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If 
___ find that your output has become too much or too little, 
please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse 
practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the 
colostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice 
your colostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink 
such as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms 
of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), 
weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If ___ notice these 
symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room 
for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ may eat a 
regular diet with your new colostomy. However it is a good idea 
to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made 
to ___ by the ostomy nurses.
 
Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care 
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ stoma 
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be 
beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times 
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around 
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the 
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed 
above. Please care for the ostomy as ___ have been instructed by 
the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ will be able to make an appointment 
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. ___ 
will have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks 
helping to monitor your ostomy until ___ are comfortable caring 
for it on your own. 
 
 
Currently your colostomy is allowing the surgery in your large 
intestine to heal, which does take some time. ___ will come back 
to the hospital for reversal of this colostomy when decided by 
Dr. ___ will follow-up in the clinic, and the 
surgeon will decide when will be the best time for your second 
surgery. Until this time there is healthy intestine that is 
still functioning as it normally would and it will produce mucus 
and some may leak or ___ may feel as though ___ need to have a 
bowel movement and ___ may sit on the toilet and empty this 
mucus, it is normal. 
 
 
Rehab D/C instructions:
 
To the Rehab:
Thank ___ for participating in the care of this patient.  This 
patient has had multiple teaching sessions with both the 
Wound/Ostomy nurses and with the staff nurses and should have a 
good idea of how to care for their own ostomy.  They have also 
been given several items that will assist them in their own 
care, such as instruction sheets, ostomy supplies, and ostomy 
output measuring tools.  However, we would like to stress a few 
important points to assist ___ in the care of this patient.

Bowel Function:  
Ø  It is important to encourage the patient to monitor their 
bowel function closely every day.  The patient should continue 
to record their colostomy output (as much as physically 
possible) and the amount of fluid they have taken in, just as 
they were taught in the hospital.  A urinal or hat should be 
used to record their ostomy output daily.  
o   The patient has been taught to use a daily measurement chart 
to record their I&Os.  This chart should be continued to be 
used at least until their follow-up appointment. If their ostomy 
output is less than 500 ml or greater than 1200 ml of liquid 
stool in a day, it is very important to call the doctors office 
with this information. 
o   Continue to reinforce to the patient that the major risk 
with an colostomy is dehydration related to fluid loses. Daily 
fluid intake is ___ glasses of fluids, including electrolyte 
enhanced beverages.  In the hot weather, encourage them to take 
in increased amounts of fluid and closely measure 
their colostomy output.  
o   Watch for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dry 
mouth or tongue, decrease in urination, urine darker in color, 
dizzy when he/she stands, cramps in his/her abdomen or legs, 
dizziness, increased thirst, or weakness. 
Stoma Care:
Ø  It is also important to monitor the appearance of the stoma. 
The tissue of the stoma should be moist, pink or red in color. 
o   If the stoma has color changes from pink / red to dark 
purplish /blue in color, becomes swollen, or a large amount of 
continuous bleeding into the pouch, and or at the Mucocutaneous 
Junction (Stomal Incision). this is not normal. Call the 
patients doctors office for assistance.  
 If ___ or the patient has any questions regarding the care of 
the patients ostomy, please refer to the instructions provided 
to the patient by the wound/ostomy nurses. 
___ the patient develops the following bowel symptoms please call 
the surgeons office or go to the nearest emergency room if 
severe: increasing abdominal distension and cramps, nausea, 
vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, decrease 
in ostomy output, or have no output from ostomy for ___ hours

Please call the Acute Care Surgery Clinic if ___ develop fevers, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, decreased or no ostomy output, or 
other concerns. The phone number is ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to the urology service following 
debridement of scrotal and perineal abscess.  See operative 
report for full details.  The patient tolerated the procedure 
well and recovered in the PACU before transfer to the surgical 
floor.  He was admitted on zosyn/clindamycin for antibiotic 
therapy, with BID packing changes of anterior and posterior 
perineal wounds.  On POD1, he was attempted to be narrowed to 
unasyn, though spiked a fever to ___ and was again re-broadened 
to zosyn/clindamycin.  On POD2, he was narrowed to Bactrim 
empirically for better MRSA coverage and remained afebrile 
through the time of discharge.

With respect to anticoagulation, the patient was seen by the 
cardiology service, and the decision was made to restart the 
patient's ASA and Plavix immediately postoperatively, as he 
remained on it to the time of surgery and experienced no 
bleeding complications.  He did, however, remain off of his 
Coumadin for the duration of his hospital stay, and was 
instructed to restart at home dose 2d after discharge.

His foley catheter remained in place for the duration of his 
stay.  His diet was advanced as tolerated following surgery.  At 
discharge, patient's pain was well controlled with oral pain 
medications, tolerating regular diet, ambulating without 
assistance, and voiding without difficulty. Incision at 
discharge without erythema or hematoma.  He will follow-up with 
his home urologist, ___ at ___, as 
directed and complete a course of Bactrim.  He will also follow 
up with general surgery for perineal ___ removal.   ___ was 
set up to assist with packing changes and drain care.

MRI ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Punctate acute infarcts in the right hemisphere, which could 
be along ACA/MCA and MCA/PCA watershed territories or be within 
the MCA territory.
2. Chronic infarct of the superior right frontal lobe, MCA 
territory.
3. Multifocal high-grade stenoses involving the right MCA M2 
divisions. Other milder probably atherosclerotic disease as 
described above.
4. Findings compatible with underlying chronic small vessel 
ischemic disease.

CTA ___
IMPRESSION: Mild stenoses of the superior and inferior M2 
divisions of the right MCA, improved compared to recent MRA. 
This could be due to improvement in vasospasm or technical 
differences in evaluation of stable atherosclerotic 
irregularity.

Carotid Doppler ___
Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis 60-69%.

Echocardiogram ___
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is an abnormal 
systolic flow contour at rest, but no left ventricular outflow 
obstruction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Normal global 
and regional biventricular systolic function. Calcified aortic 
and mitral valves without significant stenosis or regurgitation. 
Negative bubble study. 

EKG ___
Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the previous tracing 
of ___
ventricular ectopy and left atrial abnormality are no longer 
seen.
___
___ yo woman with PMHx sig. for CVA, CAD s/p multiple PCIs, DM, 
and HTN who presented to ___ for a 
severe headache, blurry vision, and concern for increased gait 
instability.

She was transferred to ___ for further neurologic evaluation 
and MRI given concern for severe headache or neck pain ___ 
radiating to bioccipital and bitemporal areas, with hypertension 
to 200 mmHg and vomiting at ___. along with history of a 
prior stroke, despite normal CT there. 

MRI revealed punctate infarcts of the right hemisphere within 
MCA or distal MCA watersheds. Therefore, Mrs. ___ was 
admitted to Neurology for further workup.

Headache improved and no new neurologic deficits were noted - 
gait instability at baseline per patient. 

CTA was reassuring with respect to intracranial MCA stenosis, 
despite such on MRA. Carotid ultrasound revealed less than 40% R 
internal carotid stenosis. There was no known history of atrial 
fibrillation and echo demonstrated no thrombi or atrial septal 
defect. 

Headache may have related to underlying vasospasm, explaining 
improved MCA territory stenosis from MRA to CTA. Headache may 
have also related to uncontrolled hypertension. GIven that no 
embolic source was found, this was seen as the most likely 
explanation. Verapamil was started and initial heparin IV 
therapy was stopped. On final assessment probable migraine with 
vasospasm was thought most likely. Aspirin and simvastatin are 
to continued. She is discharged for follow-up with Dr. ___ 
in clinic.

INTERPRETATION: ___ yo man with h/o HTN and ECG with questionable 
old 
IMI was referred to evaluate an atypical chest discomfort and 
lightheadedness. The patient completed 12 minutes of a Gervino 
protocol 
representing an average exercise tolerance for his age; ~ 6.2 
METS. The 
exercise test was stopped at the patient's request secondary to 
fatigue. 
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported. No 
significant ST 
segment changes were noted. The rhythm was sinus with rare 
isolated APDs 
and VPDs noted. In the absence of beta blocker therapy, the 
heart rate 
response to exercise was blunted. In addition, a blunted blood 
pressure 
response to exercise was noted. 
  
IMPRESSION: Average exercise tolerance. No anginal symptoms or 
ischemic 
ST segment changes. Blunted hemodynamic response to exercise 
(see 
above). 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:

Chest pain, intermittant, associated with lightheadeness, not 
associated with activity, concerning for anginal pain; could be 
due to gastritis or a side effect of new SSRI administration in 
the past 10 days.  Fact that pt. reports that sysptoms 
alleviated immediatley by the administration of asa by EMS 
personnel unusual - no EMS documentation in pt. record.  I 
remain concerned that this was more likely ntg administration 
concurrently that may have resolved pain. 

Stable and chronic issues include: HTN, HCL.

Hospital course: 

Troponin T negative times three.  Exercise stress test (non 
imaging) was performed, result above.  Pt. had no symptoms of 
chest pain or dizziness during this episode.  On further review, 
pt. reported that chest pain and dizziness are most notable when 
taking celexa - especially if he takes it on an empty stomach.  
He also states that his chest pain is most consistent with his 
acid reflux - and that this and dizziness are alleviated by 
eating.  

He endorses lonliness.  I have suggested that he continue to 
take the SSRI, as the side effects of dizziness and GI upset 
often resolve with continued administration of this medication.  
He agrees with this.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old ___ woman with a PMHx of 
TIIDM, pituitary mass s/p resection ___, and hyperlipidemia who 
presents as a direct admission to the EMU due to her history of 
seizures, recent lapses in memory, and fatigue for better 
characterization of her seizures and medication adjustment. She 
is followed outpatient by Dr. ___. The HPI is 
obtained from previous notes and from interview with patient 
through an interpreter.

In brief, Ms. ___ initially presented to the Access Neurology 
clinic in ___ with five episodes of loss of 
consciousness which were thought to be seizures. These episodes 
were not well characterized, but per her son-in-law, occurred 
while at work in a ___ restaurant, while she was sleeping at 
home, and at ___, when she was found at the store with no 
shoes and no recollection of how she got to the store. The 
patient does not recall these episodes, but states that her 
husband described the final two episodes as foaming at the mouth 
and jerking of her hands. She was started initially by her PCP 
on ___ 750 BID. 

After self-discontinuing this medication due to GI side effects 
attributed to it, she experienced one more episode in ___. She has not had any episodes with jerking of her 
extremities or loss of awareness, such as the ___ 
incident since re-starting her Keppra after this. She does 
however complain of light-headedness, fatigue, and brief memory 
lapses. She characterizes the memory lapses as being in a room 
and forgetting why she is there, or holding an object in her 
hands such as plates and forgetting why she is holding them and 
what she is doing with them. This happens ___ times per day and 
did not occur prior to her first seizure. She denies vertigo, 
poor sleep, ___, jamais ___, paresthesias. However she does 
endorse a rising sense of fear in her abdomen that is sometimes 
associated with these episodes. 

Routine EEG in ___ showed an electrographic seizure from 
the right temporal region as well as periodic discharges. MRI 
from ___ is reviewed in detail below, but in brief 
showed no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect and 
showed a nonspecific right temporal superficial soft tissue 
density which was previously noted on head CT. 

Given these new episodes of memory lapse, continued seizure 
activity on EEG despite levetiracetam, and possible toxicity 
from levetiracetam resulting in fatigue and dizziness, Ms. ___ 
is admitted for EEG monitoring and medication adjustment. 

Her further is also notable for a history of a resection of 
pituitary mass in ___. She reports having double vision prior 
to discovery of the mass. It also appears that she received 
radiation therapy post-operatively. It is unclear at this time 
what evaluation or monitoring has been done from an 
endocrinologic perspective since her arrival to the ___. 
Furthermore, she has been incidentally found to have a right 
frontotemporal nonspecific superficial soft tissue density on 
imaging, the etiology of which is unclear but could be related 
to her surgery. 

On neuro ROS, she endorses having headache ___ times per week 
with associated visual phenomenon of seeing ""shadows"" in her 
vision. The headache is most prominent across the front of her 
forehead and extends to her temples bilaterally. While she 
endorses having had diplopia prior to her pituitary surgery, she 
currently denies diplopia. She additionally denies dysarthria, 
dysphagia, difficulties producing or comprehending speech.

On general review of systems, the pt denies chest pain, SOB. She 
endorses dry mouth.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ speaking only woman with a past 
medical history significant for a pituitary mass resected in 
___ in ___ that she was told was benign; type 2 diabetes; 
hyperlipidemia who started having episodes of memory lapses over 
the last one to ___ years. For example, she would be performing 
activity such as doing the dishes and then suddenly not remember 
why she had dishes in her hands. She was evaluated by Dr. 
___ in ___ ___ Department and an EEG was obtained on 
___, which revealed one electrographic seizure with a 
right temporal onset and without clear clinical correlate and 
temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity as well as 
frequent left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges 
occurring in 1 Hz periodic runs as well as intermittent focal 
slowing of the left frontotemporal region indicative of focal 
cerebral dysfunction. Her Keppra was continued at that time at 
750 mg b.i.d. She has continued to have episodes of 
forgetfulness and has subsequently been let go from her job. She 
was admitted to the EMU for cvEEG in order to evaluate for any 
evidence of subclinical seizures as well as her medication 
optimization. In addition to her home dose of lamotrigine 1500 
mg daily, she was started on lacosamide 50 mg twice daily, which 
was subsequently increased to 150 mg twice daily, or 300 mg 
daily dose. One seizure was detected at 1738 on ___ with ___ Hz 
rhythmic discharges that rapidly lateralized over the left 
temporal region with no obvious clinical correlate. This lasted 
approximately 10 seconds. She also had frequent independent 
right and left mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges admixed 
with sharp bursts of rhythmic theta but no other seizures. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Consider wean from Keppra, given her report of increased 
fatigue since starting Keppra. 
-FSH, LH, TSH, and prolactin were all measured for further 
evaluation of her endocrine status after resection of pituitary 
mass. All levels were lower than reference ranges.

admit for
further pain management and monitoring in setting of multiple 
rib fractures with
hypoxia.

By HD2, pain was well controlled. The patient was ambulating 
independently in room and halls therefore ___ did not evaluate 
him. Oxygen was successfully weaned off and the patient had an 
oxygen saturation of 93-94% on room air at the time of 
discharge. 
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and 
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive 
spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The 
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were 
used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Acute lateral left eighth and ninth rib fractures 

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
* Your injury caused 2 left sided rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to Emergency Department on ___. The 
trauma general surgery team evaluated the patient and performed 
a primary and a secondary survey. He was found to have rib 
fractures and periorbital swelling. Ophthalmology evaluated the 
patient and recommended  - Dedicated CT orbits will better 
characterize superficial shrapnel burden however there is no 
clinical evidence of intraocular FB or clinically significant 
intraorbital FB- Artificial tears to right eye QID, more as 
needed for irritation - GenTeal gel QHS to right eye  - can 
apply erythromycin ophthalmic ointment to lids if irritated- 
Follow up in ophthalmology clinic 2 weeks, sooner PRN. The 
recommendations were following. The patient was then admitted to 
the Acute Care Surgery Unit for further management of the 
overall injuries.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization and pain was well controlled.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 

GI/GU/FEN: The patient was tolerating a regular diet. Patient's 
intake and output were closely monitored

ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ falling a trauma. You were found to 
have rib fractures and ___ swelling. You have recovered 
well and are now ready for discharge. 

* Your injury caused right sided ___ rib fractures which 
can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow 
breaths because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

You were also found to have a right sided ___ swelling. 
If you have any worsening symptoms or change in vision please 
return to your closest emergency department.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female
with history of alcoholic cirrhosis decompensated by grade I
varices and two recent hospitalizations for hepatic
encephalopathy, alcohol use disorder in remission, and
non-obstructive coronary artery disease referred directly from
___ clinic for incidental cholestatic injury, rising MELD
and imminent transplant candidacy in that regard, and serial lab
monitoring.

Patient was first hospitalized from ___ for hepatic
encephalopathy secondary to lactulose non-adherence and
pan-sensitive E. coli UTI. She incidentally developed acute on
chronic anemia, prompting endoscopy, which revealed one cord of
grade I varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy without
stigmata of bleeding. She was likewise hospitalized from ___
for hepatic encephalopathy secondary to dehydration. Her
mentation promptly resolved with hydration and was discharged on
rifaximin. 

She explains, ""I felt really good [after discharge]"" for an
estimated 1.5 to 2 weeks, when ""things [then] went downhill,""
meaning ""no energy"" and jaundice. She is not sleeping well due 
to
intense pruritus and is napping during the day. Her daughter
adds, ""It doesn't take much to get her exhausted [now]...like 
one
errand."" She endorses anorexia and dysgeusia in recent days, and
estimates a 5-pound weight loss since last hospitalization. She
has not been confused and is taking her lactulose, noting ___
bowel movements some days and ___ on others. She has vague,
occasional ""crampy"" abdominal pain, which is not particularly
bothersome.

She recently completed a course of amoxicillin for a dental
procedure, but denies other new medications or over-the-counter
protein supplements or vitamins. Her colestipol was recently
intensified, but she thinks her fatigue and jaundice pre-dated
this. She continues to abstain from alcohol. Her routine
surveillance labs on ___ revealed worsening hyperbilirubinemia
(i.e., total bilirubin 11 to 23.4, then 21.7 today), prompting
expedited follow-up today. She underwent MRCP and was then
admitted directly for serial lab monitoring.

days of fevers, shortness of beath, yellow productive cough, 
pleuritic chest pain with CXR showing multifocal pneumonia. 

# Multifocal Community Acquired Pneumonia: Most likely from 
non-opportunistic organisms such as strep pneumonia or 
atypicals. Per patient he has been very compliant with his HIV 
med and last CD4 count was 395 and VL undetectable therefore 
making opportunistic infection such as PCP less likely. He is 
currently hemodynamically stable with normal lactate and normal. 
Creatinine suggesting good organ perfusion. He recieved 
levofloxacin and subsequently developed a rash, which has also 
been documented before so we will transition to alternate 
antibiotic regimen for CAP.
- Will treat for 8 day course of Augmentin + Azithromycin
- Urine strep Ag pending at time of discharge.

# Rash: Resolved. Mr. ___ developed a pruritic rash over arms, 
neck and leg after administration of vancomycin and levofloxacin 
in the ED. He improved with benadryl. He has a previous history 
of rash documented at ___ that occurred after 
administration of levofloxacin and fragmin. He tolerated 
levofloxacin subsequently without rash so this medication was 
continued at that time. The recurrence of this rash with 
levofloxacin is concerning for a true allergy. As such we will 
avoid this medication and transition to alternate treatment as 
above.
- levofloxacin allergy recorded at ___ and ___ 
___

# Hyponatremia: Sodium 131 on admission. This has been seen on 
prior hospitalization. Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia as 
improved with aggressive IV fluids. Sodium on discharge 136.
# HIV: continue Stribild
# Depression: continue Zoloft

TRANSITIONAL:
- complete 8 day course of augmentin and azithromycin
- Per previous records, CT scan in ___ showed RUL nodule that 
was most likely infectious in etiology. It was recommended that 
followup CT be obtained when infectious symptoms had resolved.

Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure meeting and taking care of you. You were 
admitted with fever, cough and shortness of breath. You were 
found to have a pneumonia on a chest radiograph. You were 
initially treated with an antibiotic called levofloxacin, but 
developed a rash to this medication. We believe you are allergic 
to this medication as you have had a rash with it before. 
Instead of this medication, you should take medications called 
augmentin (a seven day course) and azithromycin (a four day 
course) to complete 8 total days of antibiotics. You should also 
followup with Dr. ___ as an outpatient. 

We wish you the best, 

Your ___ team

DISCHARGE LABS:

ECHO ___:
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. No left 
atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal 
echocardiography). Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with normal cavity size, and regional/global systolic function 
(biplane LVEF = 66 %). There is no left ventricular outflow 
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with 
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta and aortic 
arch are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space 
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

 IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Left atrial dilation. No 
structural cardiac cause of syncope identified. 
 These findings are c/w hypertensive heart.

 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
 The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on ___ 
ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram 
is suggested in ___ years

CXR PA & LATERAL ___:
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT trachea ___ 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size appears mildly 
enlarged.  
Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  Crowding 
of 
bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary 
edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of 
atelectasis, though infection is difficult to exclude in the 
correct clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax 
is present.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted in 
the thoracic spine. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most 
likely 
reflective of atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded in the 
correct 
clinical setting. 

KNEE XRAY (3 views) ___:
COMPARISON:  ___ left knee radiographs 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
No acute fracture or dislocation is identified.  Mild 
tricompartmental 
degenerative changes with osteophytic spurring are demonstrated, 
most 
pronounced in the patellofemoral and lateral compartments of the 
knee.  A 
moderate size joint effusion is present.  Vascular 
calcifications are seen 
diffusely.  No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous 
abnormalities is 
identified.  There are no radiopaque foreign bodies. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
No acute fracture or dislocation.  Moderate size joint effusion. 

  

CT HEAD w/o CONTRAST ___:
FINDINGS:  
  
There is no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or 
mass.  There is mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci 
suggestive of involutional changes. Scattered subcortical and 
periventricular white matter hypodensities are nonspecific, 
however likely represent the sequela of chronic small vessel 
ischemic disease. 
  
There is soft tissue swelling overlying the left orbit, but the 
globe appears intact.  No retrobulbar hematoma is seen.  There 
is no evidence of fracture. There is partial opacification of 
the right mastoid air cells suggestive of mild ongoing 
inflammation.  The visualized portion of the paranasal 
sinuses,left mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are 
clear. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Left periorbital soft tissue swelling without fracture.  No 
acute intracranial process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The ___ hospital course was remarkable in relation to his 
slow atrial fibrillation and second degree AV Block. He had 
multiple pauses on telemetry 20 seconds or more and was 
recommended for pacemaker insertion. He initially declined  the 
procedure but after further consideration and discussion with 
Dr. ___ the risks therein, proceeded with implantation. 
 He remained therapeutic with his Coumadin and will continue to 
be followed with his PCP at discharge. He was placed on IV 
antibiotics and will transition to PO antibiotics at discharge. 
He had multiple studies and exams performed while here and his 
CT was negative for acute changes. His left eye remained stable 
and swelling and ecchymosis was gradually and noticeably 
improving.  He continued to complain of left knee pain. He 
reported hitting the tibial tuberosity which remained tender to 
palpation but without erythema or excess warmth.  Knee xrays 
showed only chronic changes in relation to osteoarthritis 
(tri-compartmental and prominent about the patello-femoral 
compartment).  He has baseline numbness of his bilateral hands 
related to his canal narrowing as seen on MRI in ___.  
Surgery was discussed but he has foregone this for now, 
preferring to wait and observe for worsening symptoms. He was 
counseled to reconsider this decision and to avoid delay of any 
worsening symptoms, increasing numbness, strength and 
coordination. Physical Therapy was consulted and felt continued 
home therapy was appropriate to help with falls prevention, gait 
training, conditioning and safety, especially in light of his 
weight bearing restrictions on the left upper extremity 
following his pacemaker. 

His device was interrogated on the day of discharge and a CXR 
was completed confirming proper placement of the device and 
leads. He was seen by Physical Therapy given his recent syncopal 
episode and underlying musculoskeletal symptoms and deemed 
appropriate for discharge on ___.  He will follow up with 
Device Clinic in one week, has been recommended to have his INR 
checked on ___ which is followed through the ___ 
___ clinic, and continue follow up with his PCP, ___. 
___.  Additionally, given his chronic atrial fibrillation he has 
been recommended to have follow up with ___ Cardiology as 
well, for a first available appointment. This has been requested 
through Care Connections to the Cardiology team and he will be 
contacted with an appointment at home when known.

Discharge Diagnosis:
syncope with loss of consciousness
atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital following a visit to the ED 
after a syncopal episode with a loss of consciousness. You were 
monitored on telemetry and were found to have a slow atrial 
fibrillation rate response with multiple pauses and referred for 
pacemaker implant as this could result in complete heart block. 
A single chamber pacemaker was placed on ___.  You were 
continued on all of your current medications, including your 
Coumadin. You will need to follow up in Device Clinic in one 
week (appt. information noted below). You were placed on IV 
antibiotics while here and will continue oral antibiotics for 
three days to prevent surgical site infection. It is important 
to take all of this medication as prescribed. Your Coumadin 
should continue to be followed as per your chronic schedule. You 
will need to follow up with your PCP as well within 30 days 
(appointment information included below). Your next INR should 
be drawn as per the ___ clinic, we are 
recommending a draw on ___.  Your INR at discharge on 
___ was 1.9 and you will take your chronic dosing which is 5 mg 
for 6 days a week with 2 mg on ___.  

You had hit your head during your syncopal episode as well as 
your eye and sustained an injury to your left orbit but no 
fracture or hematoma.  You had resultant bruising from this 
injury but remained otherwise stable.  A CT of your head was 
performed and there was no internal hemorrhage. (results of CT 
are below). Additionally you complained of left knee pain and 
radiographs were done which showed no acute fracture. You do 
have chronic osteoarthritis most pronounced about the knee cap 
(patello-femoral area) which is chronic. You were seen by 
Physical Therapy for evaluation prior to discharge to home. You 
should follow up with your PCP and obtain referral to an 
orthopedic physician for further workup and care for your 
osteoarthritis of the knee. We recommend the use of ice, 20 
minutes at a time per hour up to 5 times daily, along with 
Tylenol for pain.

You were seen by Physical Therapy and evaluated for safe 
discharge to home. Based upon their recommendations, they are 
recommending home physical therapy to work on gait training, use 
of assistive device (cane) and strengthening and falls 
prevention. Services have been requested on your behalf prior to 
your discharge from the hospital from ___ Services.

  You also reported continuing numbness of bilateral hands and 
reported you had prior to admission and an MRI was performed in 
___ which was reviewed showing cervical spondylosis and 
canal narrowing and have not pursued surgical consultation. It 
is recommended that you continue follow up with your PCP and 
obtain surgical referral if your decision changes in that regard 
or if your symptoms worsen. This is critical as your MRI does 
canal narrowing.

DISCHARGE LABS:   NONE, PATIENT MADE CMO AND EXPIRED

MICRO:
___ BLOOD CULTURE:  PENDING
___ URINE CULTURE:   NO GROWTH.

IMAGING: 
___  ECG
Normal sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Intraventricular 
conduction delay. No previous tracing available for comparison.  


___  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated to the left. The patient is 
status post median sternotomy. There is moderate pulmonary 
edema. More confluent opacity at the right lung base may relate 
to vascular congestion however a consolidation due to pneumonia 
is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no 
evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. 
The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 

___  Portable TTE 
Conclusions   
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function 
could not be assessed. There is a mild resting left ventricular 
outflow tract obstruction. The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated 
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. A bioprosthetic aortic 
valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher 
than expected for this type of prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic 
valve leak is probably present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There 
is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to 
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet 
is eccentric and may be underestimated. [Due to acoustic 
shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
near-hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. The right 
ventricle is dilated and hypokinetic with moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Bioprosthetic 
AVR with high gradients - likely a combination of a relatively 
small valve and hyperdynamic function. The leaflets as seen on 
images #21 and #22 seem to move well although there is 
significant calcification seen at ___ o'clock on the short axis 
views. It is not clear if this is outside the valve or not. At 
least mild mitral regurgitation. Mild calcific mitral stenosis. 
Biatrial dilation.   

___  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of pulmonary edema, without 
effusions. 

___  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right 
or left lower extremity veins. 

___  ECG
Sinus rhythm. Prolonged Q-T interval. Left ventricular 
hypertrophy. No major change from the previous tracing. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F w/ hx of AVR, CABG in ___, PAF on sotalol, HTN, HLD w/ 
recent echo showing preserved ejection fraction with acute on 
subacute worsening dyspnea in the setting of leukocytosis and 
CXR findings c/w PNA, found to have volume overload on exam with 
increased work of breathing initially requiring BiPAP but later 
made comfort care only after unsuccessful attempts at diuresis 
and development of acute renal failure.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#ACUTE DECOMPENSATED DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: LVEF >55%, mild 
symmetric LVH, MAC, +MR. ___ consistent with heart 
failure exacerbation in the setting of PNA. She initially 
responded to IV lasix boluses but quickly developed acute renal 
failure and persistent oxygen requirement. PE was considered in 
the differential given +D-dimer and increased WOB but LENIs were 
negative for DVT and symptomatology was not consistent. Patient 
and family was approached regarding elective intubation and 
right heart cath but declined as this was felt to be too 
invasive. After a meeting with the patient and her family 
(including HCP), patient was made DNR/DNI. Medical team and 
family agreed to try high dose IV Lasix and if this was 
unsuccessful, patient would be made comfort care only. 
Unfortunately, high dose IV diuresis was unsuccessful and 
patient was made comfort care only on ___. Palliative care was 
consulted to assist with comfort measures. Patient expired on 
___ at 16:51PM with family at bedside.

#PNA: Patient presented with leukocytosis characterized by a 
left shift. This in combination with her CXR which was 
suggestive of a RLL opacification, was concerning for PNA. This 
PNA also likely contributed if not caused her CHF exacerbation. 
She was treated with CTX and azithromycin. Antibiotics were 
withdrawn once patient was made comfort care only.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Atrial fibrillation: Patient remained in atrial fibrillation 
throughout admission. She was continued on her home sotalol on 
admission but this was withdrawn once patient was made CMO.

#HTN: Normotensive on admission. Home BP meds were held on 
admission especially in the setting of diuresis. 

#HLD: Stable, she was continued on her home pravastatin which 
was discontinued once she was made CMO.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
NONE
 
Medications on Admission:

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old woman with history of mild chronic 
hypoNa attributed to SIADH, HTN, COPD and etoh use disorder who 
presents with confusion and worsening hypoNa. 

#Acute metabolic encephalopathy:
#Hyponatremia:
Patient's confusion and forgetfulness is likely due to acute on 
chronic hyponatremia ___ poor solute intake (""tea and toast"", or 
""wine and toast"") as well as possible mild SIADH (elevated UNa 
and UOsm). It is unclear why she would have SIADH, no 
intrapulmonary process on CXR.  She has a lung nodule which has 
been stable on serial imaging. DDx also includes toxic metabolic 
encephalopathy from chronic alcohol use vs alcohol withdrawal 
(although currently not exhibiting any signs). Unlikely to be 
infection (given clear CXR and UA), head trauma (no recent 
history of head strike) medication side effects (not on any 
culprit meds).  Na improved to recent baseline with free water 
restriction and salt tabs.  She was encouraged to increase her 
solute intake.  TSH, B12, folate wnl. B1 pending on discharge.

Given her encephalopathy, ___ and OT were consulted and found 
significant deficits concerning for her safety.  Her MMSE was 
___ suggestive of mild-moderate cognitive impairment.  Her 
family echoed these concerns about safety at home and she is now 
discharged to rehab. She should have cognitive neurology follow 
up as an outpatient. 

#Facial Rash: 
Mild cellulitis vs dermatitis with faint erythema, induration.  
Does not appear to be shingles given lack of a dermatomal 
distribution and no vescicular lesions.  In the outpatient 
setting was given Keflex and steroid.  Her Keflex should be 
continued through ___ to complete a ___TOH use disorder
#Fall safety risk: 
Per daughter in law, patient has longstanding history of ETOH 
use disorder (about 2 gallons a wine per week), with prior 
history of falls (twice last year). She was able to ambulate 
independently at home, however now needs help with paying bills. 
Family is concerned about patient's ability to take care of 
herself at home and have entertained the possibility of 
placement.  See above for evaluation.  She did not trigger on 
CIWA

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with a history of COPD, bronchiectasis, CAD 
s/p MI with stent, among other medical issues who presented with 
shortness of breath and increased cough and sputum production 
consistent with her prior COPD flares.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:

# COPD exacerbation: Patient presented with symptoms similar to 
her prior COPD exacerbations. Cannot exclude infectious etiology 
however white count non-elevated, CXR consistent w/COPD. 
Throughout the admission the patient has not needed supplemental 
O2. She was treated with steroids, azithromycin, and PRN nebs. 
Azithromycin was transitioned to doxycycline prior to discharge. 
She remained stable with no worsening of symptoms. At time of 
discharge, she is able to ambulate safely with a O2 sat in mid 
90's. As her symptoms were not progressing and she was 
saturating well on room air, we discharged her to follow-up with 
PCP for further care. Of note, she asked us to provide her with 
home nebulizer machine. We did not feel that was necessary. We 
provided her with prescription for MDI plus spacer and urged her 
to speak with her PCP if she believes she would benefit from 
home nebulizer machine. 

# Nausea: Patient complained of some morning nausea, with no 
clear etiology. She noted that she would feel better after 
eating or having her morning coffee. She received IV zofran PRN 
for the nausea. No emesis on this admission. It had resolved by 
time of discharge.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: 

# CAD: Her home medications of metoprolol succinate and aspirin 
162 daily were continued continued on this stay. She did not 
have any chest pain or symptoms suggestive of cardiac origin for 
her shortness of breath or nausea.

# Lung nodule: Patient has known lung nodules which have been 
documented on prior CT scan. Nodule found incidentally on CXR, 
and per report of location seems that it may be consistent with 
location of previously known nodules. We recommended that this 
be followed up on an outpatient basis. Radiology recommended a 
non-urgent CT, however they may not have been aware that pt 
already has known lung lesions being followed by serial CTs. As 
above, patient has a significant smoking history.

# Tremor: Pt with resting tremor in b/l hands and head, she has 
not noticed it before. Husband has noticed and says it is not 
new. Patient was surprised when it was brought up, however it 
may be exacerbated by nebs and not as prominent at baseline. 
Most likely essential tremor, however we recommend outpatient 
follow-up by PCP for further evaluation.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

# We recommend continued outpatient follow-up of lung lesions

# Tremor is likely benign, however may need to be evaluated 
further

IMAGING:
=========
TTE (___):
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the degree of MR seen has decreased. AS is not appreciated.  

CXR (___):
There is a right-sided PICC line terminating in the mid SVC.  
Patient rotation contributes to exaggeration of the cardiac 
size, which is likely normal. Segmental atelectasis is noted, 
particular in the right lung, although there does appear to be 
new pulmonary edema superimposed on this. There may be small 
tiny effusions. There is no pneumothorax. 

Renal U/S (___):
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis. 
2. Extremely limited Doppler evaluation due to technically 
limited study, 
demonstrating both kidneys to be vascularized.  No further 
Dopp;er analysis could be obtained. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with HCV cirrhosis ___ years 
s/p OLD and h/o DVT and PE (on Coumadin) who was transferred 
from an OSH with chest pain, which resolved on admission, but 
found to have supratherapeutic INR and ___.

# Acute on chronic kidney disease:  Cr up to 2.2 on admission 
from baseline of 1.4-1.5.  Cr rose to 2.7 after albumin/IVF 
boluses.  Muddy brown casts were seen on urine sediment.  Per 
renal, multiple hypotensive episodes and bradycardia likely 
resulted in ATN.  Patient's creatinine slowly improved after 
starting diuretics.  Cr on discharge was 2.1.  Kidney function 
is expected to recover with time.

# Anasarca:  Patient was grossly anasarcic after being volume 
resuscitated with albumin for hypotension.  TTE was largely 
unchanged.  Patient was diuresed with 40-80 mg IV Lasix/day and 
his edema improved.  He was discharged on torsemide 40 mg po 
daily.

# Hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p OLT:  Transplanted in ___, on 
cyclosporine 75 mg q12h.  MMF was stopped in clinic in 
___ and LFTs remained normal.  HCV VL 342,000 IU/mL on 
___.  Last biopsy was performed at previous admission 
revealed Grade ___ inflammation, no acute cellular rejection, no 
steatosis or ballooning, and stage ___ fibrosis.   Atovaquone 
was continued for prophylaxis.  Cyclosporine was decreased to 50 
mg q12h and levels were monitored.

# Supratherapeutic INR:  Patient's Coumadin was held on 
admission for supratherapeutic INR.  He received vitamin K for 
INR 5.2 and INR then became subtherapeutic.  Warfarin was 
restarted with a heparin gtt until INR became therapeutic.  INR 
became supratherapeutic again and Coumadin dose was adjusted.  
INR on discharge was 3.6.  He was discharged on Coumadin 1 mg 
daily.

# Hypertension:  Patient was initially hypotensive and losartan 
and diuretics were held.  He received an albumin bolus with 
improvement in his blood pressure.  He then became hypertensive 
during the latter part of his hospitalization (SBP up to 
170/180s).  Losartan continued to be held given ___.  Patient 
was started on amlodipine 5 mg daily, which can be uptitrated as 
needed.

# Prior left knee infection s/p hardware removal in ___:  
Patient has chronic pain related to his previous knee 
infection/hardware removal.  He also has shallow venous stasis 
ulcers on bilateral lower extremities.  Patient's orthopedic 
surgeon plans to replace his knee hardware once his ulcers have 
healed and his leg swelling has resolved.  Patient's pain was 
well-controlled on home Oxycontin and po Dilaudid.  He became 
confused after receiving IV Dilaudid, so this was avoided.   

# Catheter-associated UTI:  Initial urine culture was negative.  
Repeat urine culture after catheter was placed grew >100,000 
Klebsiella sensitive to ceftriaxone.  Foley was exchanged and 
patient completed a 7 day course of ceftriaxone.  Foley was 
removed prior to discharge.

# Chest Pain:  Patient had chest pain at OSH, which resolved on 
admission here.  No ischemic changes on EKG and three sets of 
cardiac enzymes were negative.  Considered PE, especially given 
h/o prior PE, but patient had been therapeutic on Coumadin.  CTA 
was deferred given ___.

# Atrial fibrillation/pauses:  Not on agents for rate or rhythm 
control.  During last admission (___), patient was 
bradycardic at night with ___ second pauses seen on telemetry. 
 Patient continued to have pauses with HR ___, though rates 
improved to ___ without intervention.  It is unclear if these 
pauses are contributing to hypotensive episodes.  Patient is 
followed by Dr. ___ have further outpatient EP 
evaluation if warranted. 
 
# Hyponatremia:  Na persistently low (as low as 130s), which is 
chronic per review of prior discharge summaries.  Hyponatremia 
neither responded to nor worsened with albumin or diuretics.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[ ] Please check labs (CBC, CMP, LFTs, cyclosporine level, INR, 
and PTT) on ___. Send labs to the ___ at ___ 
___.
[ ] INR 3.6 on discharge. Please hold Coumadin on ___. 
Restart Coumadin at 1 mg daily on ___. Recheck INR on 
___. Goal INR 2.0-3.0
[ ] Patient was started on torsemide 40 mg daily for leg edema. 
This should be decreased/discontinued if kidney function 
worsens.
[ ] Losartan held given ___. Amlodipine 5 mg daily started for 
hypertension. Uptitrate to 10 mg daily as needed for blood 
pressure.
[ ] Cyclosporine dose decreased from 75 mg q12h to 50 mg q12h.
[ ] Patient is followed by Dr. ___. Consider further 
evaluation of bradycardia/pauses if indicated (note: bradycardia 
improved, pauses persisted)
[ ] Patient will have follow-up scheduled with orthopedics and 
neurology (for pre-op clearance, per ortho). Ortho plans to 
replace his left knee after venous stasis ulcers have healed and 
after lower extremity swelling has resolved.
[ ] PICC kept in place given need for frequent lab draws.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___.  You 
were admitted because your kidney function was abnormal.  This 
was likely due to damage to your kidneys from intermittently 
having low blood pressure.  Your kidney function slowly 
recovered and will hopefully continue to improve.  You were 
given medications to remove fluid from your legs.  After your 
leg swelling resolves and your leg ulcers heal, the orthopedic 
surgeons will replace your knee.  Your blood pressure became 
high, so you were started on a new medication to help with this.

It is very important that you continue to take your medications 
as prescribed and keep your follow-up appointments.

We wish you good health!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

right-sided heart failure (EF 50%), with congestive hepatopathy 
and ascites, severe pulmonary hypertension, and CAD s/p CABG 
___ who had ongoing tooth pain as an outpatient.  She was 
directly admitted to Medicine for Heparin bridge while her INR 
was allowed to drift downwards in order to undergo tooth 
extraction.  She underwent uncomplicated single extraction of 
tooth #28 on ___ and then remained in house on a Heparin drip 
until her INR was therapeutic again, and then she was discharged 
home.

No signs or symptoms of severe infection.  OMFS performed 
uncomplicated single extraction of tooth #28 on ___, with 
pre-operative Unasyn.  No bleeding complications.  The procedure 
was done in the OR but only under local anesthesia.  Sutures 
will dissolve.  She will follow up with her dentist or OMFS, as 
she prefers.

## MECHANICAL MV REPLACEMENT: on Warfarin, goal INR 2.5-3.5.
As soon as she was directly admitted to the Medicine floor, she 
was placed on Heparin gtt and her Warfarin was held.  She was 
therapeutic for the duration of her admission, except for 
stopping the drip 6 hrs pre-procedure.  It was able to be 
re-started immediately post-operatively, and she was restarted 
on her Warfarin post-operatively as well.  Heparin gtt was 
stopped and she was discharged when her INR was >2.5.  Home 
Warfarin dose was not changed; she will f/u tomorrow at ___ 
___ clinic for INR check.

Her tricuspid regurgitation is severe and moderate pulmonary 
hypertension; she was euvolemic on exam.  She was continued on 
her home meds (torsemide, metoprolol, hctz, spironolactone).

## HYPONa: asymptomatic, stable.
Na 133 on admission.  Euvolemic on exam. Baseline Na appears to 
be 133-140.  She remains on HCTZ, Torsemide, Spironolactone 
which could be contributing.  Na was stable at 132 on the day of 
discharge.

declined the proposed sliding scale (she felt that she would 
drop too low since she was NPO for the procedure) and was 
subsequently hyperglycemic in the 200's-300's.  When her family 
brought in her home sliding scale, it was entered and she 
complied, with much better blood glucose control.  She did not 
have any hypoglycemia during this admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent urgent 
coronary artery bypass graft times six.  Left internal mammary 
artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein 
grafts to posterior descending artery, obtuse marginal 1 and 2, 
and diagonal 1 and 2, and Endoscopic harvesting of the long 
saphenous vein.  See operative note for full deatils. Overall 
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively 
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery 
and invasive monitoring. Post-operative day one found the 
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. 
Initially she had no underlying rhythm and remained DDD paced. 
The electrophysiology service was consulted.  Lopressor was 
initiated once the patient regained her rhythm and she was 
tolerating beta blockers with a rate in the 80's.  The patient 
was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no 
inotropic or vasopressor support. She was gently diuresed toward 
the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Mediastinal chest tubes 
were removed and the pleural chest tube stayed in an additional 
day due to an air leak.  After the pleural chest tube was on 
waterseal for greater than ___ hours with a small stable 
left pneumothorax, pleural chest tube was pulled. Follow up 
chest radiograph showed small stable left pneumothorax. Pacing 
wires were discontinued without complication on post-operative 
day four. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy 
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time 
of discharge on post-operative day six the patient was 
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to ___ 
Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after an ileostomy takedown. 
You have recovered from this procedure well and you are now 
ready to return home. You have tolerated a regular diet, passing 
 
gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. 
You may return home to finish your recovery.  
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not

acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function 
but your should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose 
stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood 
are expected however, if you notice that you are passing bright 
red blood with bowel your please seek medical attention. If you 
are passing loose stool without improvement please call the 
office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. 
If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that 
you will have some constipation. Please take an over the counter 
stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms does not 
improve call the office. It is also not uncommon after an 
ileostomy takedown to have frequent loose stools until you are 
taking more regular food however this should improve.  
The muscles of the sphincters have not been used in quite some 
time and you may experience urgency or small amounts of 
incontinence however this should improve. If you do not show 
improvement in these symptoms within ___ days please call the

please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if 
 
severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonged loose stool, or constipation.  
 
You have a small wound where the old ileostomy once was. This 
should be covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing. The wound 
no longer requires packing with gauze packing strip. Please  
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a 
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may  
shower, let the warm water run over the wound line and pat the 
area dry with a towel, do not rub. Please apply a new gauze 
dressing after showering.  
 
No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by your surgical team. You may gradually 
increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy exercise 
with your surgical team.

Metastatic colon cancer to left ureter
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left nephroureterectomy

 
History of Present Illness:
Dear Doctors:

I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Ms. ___, today at the ___ in
followup.  I performed cystoscopy on her today after a urine
cytology demonstrated malignant cells consistent with colon
cancer.  I had previously counseled her and seen her regarding
her positive PET scan, which demonstrated a potential tumor in
the left ureter.  However, she has a history of a completely
obstructed left upper tract.  Therefore, I did not expect to see
a positive urine cytology if she was indeed completely 
obstructed
and the only disease was in her ureter.  I, therefore, brought
her back for a cystoscopy to evaluate her bladder to make sure
that there were no additional tumors in her bladder.

I performed flexible cystoscopy today, which is dictated
separately.  It turns out that she does have a tumor in her
bladder, near her left ureteral orifice.  This was pedunculated
in nature, and had appearance similar to transitional cell
carcinoma, although I could not make a diagnosis visually.  I 
did
take a small biopsy of it for histologic diagnosis and 
cauterized
the biopsy defect.

This is a surprising finding, but it is a good thing that we
evaluated the bladder, for we were planning left
nephroureterectomy, and this would have been an unexpected
finding.  Depending on what the histology shows, this will have
different implications for her prognosis and for the future
treatment plan.

For example, if this is colon cancer, then a left
nephroureterectomy with a larger bladder cuff, encompassing this
tumor could be a reasonable treatment, as there is no other
obvious site of disease.  If this is TCC, then this is a
different story and I would not be able to fully explain her
elevated CEA.  She would likely still need removal of this
bladder tumor as well as left kidney and ureter, but her
prognosis would likely be different, and we would have to look
for other sites of disease.  I will bring her back in two weeks
for a revisit and discussion of the biopsy results, and we will
have a conversation then about what this implies and what we can
do for her going forward.  Dr. ___ was present in clinic
today, so I did show him the results of the cystoscopy visually,
and we are in agreement in regards to the plan going forward.

Thank you very much again for allowing me to participate in her
care, and please feel free to contact me with any questions or
concerns that you may have.

Sincerely,

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
left nephrectomy, open distal ureterectomy, transurethral 
resection of bladder cuff, retroperitoneal lymph node 
dissection. The surgery was complicated by an iatrogenic 
incision into the vagina, which was repaired. Please see 
dictated operative note for details.
The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition. On POD0-1, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient 
ambulated, restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked. The patient was a little 
nauseated for the first couple days post-operatively and she was 
kept on sips. A KUB was performed, which did not show any 
evidence of an ileus. The patient was started on anti-emetics 
and an aggressive bowel regimen. She started to have bowel 
movements on POD4 and her diet was slowly advanced. She was also 
transitioned from a PCA to oral analgesics. On POD6, JP 
creatinine was sent and showed no evidence of a urine leak. Her 
JP was subsequently removed. The patient was discharged in 
stable condition, eating well, ambulating independently, and 
with pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was 
clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection 
or infection. The patient will go home with a foley catheter for 
another ___ weeks and she will follow-up in clinic for a void 
trial.

MCH-27.2 MCHC-31.6 RDW-13.___ yo female with history of osteopenia, HL, and hypothyroidism 
admitted for syncope.  
.  
# Syncope: Although patient has had previous syncopal episodes 
in the past, she has always had prior warning of feeling hot and 
sweatty and had managed to sit down and prevent herself from 
passing out.  This episode was different.  She had no prior 
warning symptoms as before making this episode an unlikely 
vasovagal.  There was no positional changes prior to fall making 
orthostatic hypotension induced syncope unlikely.  She is also 
not on any current anti-hypertensives such as thiazides.  She 
was not exerting herself in terms of coughing/sneezing prior to 
episode making effort syncope unlikely. However, she was walking 
to the store and exerting herself minimally although she states 
this walk has never troubled her before.  No faecal/urinary 
incontinence or confusion post syncope also rules out a seizure. 
Although she denies any chest pain/palpitations/SOB/headache, 
and unremarkable cardiovascular exam, her recent ECG shows new 
atrial enlargement and slight intraventricular delay.  This 
warrants further cardiac workup to rule out transient arrhythmia 
inducing syncopal episodes.  

-ECG - no ST/T wave changes, troponin <0.01  
-monitor on telemetry  
-ECHO looking specifically at valvular function (evidence of 
aortic stenosis) which came back normal
-As per Dr. ___, patient going home with event 
recorder
-Out patient PCP and cardiology appointments  
.  
# Left hip pain: Xrays without evidence of fracture. Most likely 
contusion of left hip/sacrum.  
-tylenol standing  
-patient has been taking ibuprofen PRN for back pain, so discuss 
risks in terms of GI bleed and pre-renal failure
-small dose of oxycodone prn further pain  
-___ consult  
  
.  
# Back pain: History of osteopenia on BMD in ___. Compression 
fracture seen in lumbar spine L2 level but does not correlate to 
current symptoms. Compression fracture in the thoracic spine 
would not be an unreasonable explanation for her current 
symptoms given the mechanism of her fall.  
-thoracic spine films  
-___ as outpatient 
-Discuss commencement of Calcium and Vit D supplements as well 
as bisphosphonates even though patient has declined these in the 
past

# Leukocytosis: Most likely stress response. No signs or 
symptoms of infection.

previous episodes.  However, in order to rule out a cardiac 
cause, we took an image of your heart with an ""echo"" which was 
normal.  We will still send ___ home with an event recorder 
which ___ will have for two weeks.  The results of this can be 
reviewed with Dr. ___ and with Dr. ___ as per your 
appointments below.

prednisone 80mg PO daily, with a planned taper over 4 weeks.  
His bactrim, fluconazole and valtrex were stopped.  Opthomology 
was consulted and found no ocular involvement.  His muscositis 
pain was managed with lidocaine mouthwash, dexamthasone 
mouthwash and PO vicodin.  His rash and mucositis improved, 
though he still had substantial painful desquamation of the 
scrotuim on discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with ___ syndrome, a condition 
which affects the skin and mucous membranes.  We think this was 
caused by the antibiotic bactrim.  You were treated with 
steroids and pain medications. You will continue to take 
steroids (prednisone) for several weeks as we taper the dose 
down from 80mg to zero. You will take 60mg for 5 days, 40mg for 
5 days, 20 mg for 5 days, 10 mg for 5 days, and then stop taking 
it all together.

You should not take bactrim in the future. You can continue 
taking atripla for your HIV infection, and will continue taking 
weekly azithromax and monthly pentamidine to prevent you from 
getting opportunistic infections, until your CD4 count raises or 
your primary HIV doctor decides that you no longer need them. 
These drugs should be safe and will not cause recurrence of your 
___.

While you were here, you also showed signs of elevated heart 
rate and blood pressure. We saw that Dr. ___ 
Cardiologist, had suggested you change from amlodipine (Norvasc) 
to Metoprolol (Toprol), which will help keep your heart from 
beating too fast and also help lower your blood pressure. We are 
sending you home on a dose of 50mg Metoprolol twice daily, and 
you should follow up with Dr. ___ to see if this is 
appropriately controlling your heart rate and blood pressure.

The last thing you were followed for while here was your 
shortness of breath. Given your history of PCP, we performed two 
xrays to make sure you didn't have ongoing pneumonia. Your lungs 
are currently clear, but you should ensure that you continue 
taking your monthly pentamadine.

Please stop taking valtex and fluconazole.  Discuss all 
medication changes with your primary care doctor, ___.

HPI: 

___ is a ___ year old woman with history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior stroke with residual right
hemiparesis, localization-related epilepsy on Keppra and
lamotrigine, hypothyroidism, and glaucoma who presented to ED
from nursing home after new-onset dizziness this morning with
subsequent acute-on-chronic right lower extremity weakness.
History obtained by patient and as per chart review. 

The patient reports that she was she had seen Dr. ___
yesterday in clinic to establish new neurology clinic follow-up.
No outside records were available for evaluation at that time 
but
her baseline exam prior to new symptom onset was documented.
After her clinic appointment, she returned to her nursing home 
in
usual state of health. She woke up this morning and felt well. 
At
around 11AM, while urinating, she suddenly felt room-spinning
dizziness that resolved but was followed by an atypical 
sensation
in her right lower extremity, described as heaviness and
weakness. She notes that she has lived with her residual stroke
deficits for ___ years and never felt anything like this in her
right leg. She tried to get up from the commode but did not have
the strength and as such called for help. Throughout the rest of
the day, she notes that her right sided weakness and heaviness
was intermittent. Her dizziness has since resolved. This 
evening,
she noted that she was again feeling weaker in her right lower
extremity, requiring assistance to mobilize which is atypical 
for
her. She thus requested ED evaluation and was brought to ___.
Since arrival at ___ (~ 15 minutes prior to my evaluation) she
notes her symptoms have started to improve again. She now thinks
she may be back at baseline, or close to it. 

Per Dr. ___ initial clinic note on ___:
"" Based on history, the patient suffered a stroke ___ years ago
and was left with right hemiparesis. Since the stroke she has
been on ASA 81 mg and had no recurrent events. She also suffers
from seizures with mouth foaming, shaking and urinary
incontinence, but no generalization. She is on Keppra for
her seizures and she has not had a seizure for a long time."" His
exam at the time was notable for ""mild aphasia and dysarthria
with right facial droop and right hemiparesis."" He had no 
outside
records at that time and as primary reason for visit was to
establish neurological care, he continued her on home dose of
atorvastatin 60mg, aspirin 81 mg per his note, Keppra, and
lamictal (for mood? is what is questioned in Dr. ___.

IMAGING:

lobe suggestive of chronic incarcts. Prominent ventricles. ?
periventricular white matter hypodensity.

CTA head and neck: no large vessel occlusion, no significant
intracranial disease. 

ASSESSMENT:

THis is a ___ year old woman with HTN, hyperlipidemia, prior
stroke with right hemiparesis, recently seen in stroke neurology
clinic, who presents today for new onset dizziness and
intermittent stuttering right lower extremity 
weakness/heaviness.
Exam is notable for mild aphasia, which I suspect is at her
baseline as per Dr. ___ on ___. She is 
slightly
inattentive to ___, which his mental exam also suggests was the
case two days prior. However, I do not some slightly more
profound right hemibody weakness as compared to his exam, with 0
in ___ (previously documented as 2). The patient also endorses
loss of pinprick sensation in right lower extremity and
extinguishes on the right with DSS. 

The underlying etiology for her new symptoms remains unclear. I
am reassured by the resolution since arrival to the ED but am
concerned about the possibility of a stuttering lacune given the
intermittent right lower extremity weakness vs flow-dependent
perfusion states vs subclinical seizures vs stroke 
recrudescence.
No obvious infectious triggers on routine lab work in ED. Given
new onset of waxing/waning symptoms with significant stroke risk
factors, admission is warranted for expedited management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old woman with history of 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior stroke with residual right 
hemiparesis, localization-related epilepsy on Keppra and 
lamotrigine, hypothyroidism, and glaucoma who presented to ED
from nursing home after new-onset dizziness with subsequent 
acute-on-chronic right lower extremity weakness. Dizziness 
resolved but reported right sided ""heaviness"" persisted more so 
than her baseline deficit and thus was admitted to the stroke 
service. Upon admission to stroke service, underlying etiology 
for her new symptoms remained unclear. Cardiac origin ruled out 
with EKG and telemetry. There was resolution since arrival to 
the ED but concerning with possibility of a stuttering lacune 
given the intermittent right lower extremity weakness vs 
flow-dependent perfusion states vs subclinical seizures vs 
stroke recrudescence. No obvious infectious triggers on routine 
lab work in ED. Ultimately determined to have no stroke on MRI 
but given risk factors and past stroke burden, diagnosis of 
nonspecific sequela of cerebral infarction. 

#Nonspecific Sequela of infarction: patient reportedly had 
intermittent weakness and dizziness while at her facility. Upon 
assessment in the ED, her symptoms had significantly improved 
and she reported basically being back to baseline. NCHCT was 
ordered and read as showing multiple areas of encephalomalacia, 
including left frontoparietal, left occipital, right frontal and 
right parietal lobe suggestive of chronic infarcts. Prominent 
ventricles and periventricular white matter hypodensity. CTA 
head and neck showed no large vessel occlusion, no significant 
and no intracranial disease. She was admitted to the stroke 
service and an MRI brain was ordered. MR brain read as: Multiple 
bilateral supratentorial chronic infarcts, largest in the left 
MCA territory, with evidence of probable chronic blood products 
within right parieto-occipital infarct. No acute infarct or 
extra-axial collection. Stroke risk factor labs sent. TTE was 
done and found to have EF of 60, no cardiac origin of emboli 
observed and no PFO. ___ recommended ___ rehab. She was 
kept on ASA 325 mg. Atorvastatin 60mg kept on. 

#HYPERTENSION
She was initially taken off of her home BP meds and given BP 
chance to autoregulate given concern for stroke. Once new 
infarct ruled out on imaging, home BP meds added back. 
Metoprolol 25mg PO daily 

#HYPERLIPIDEMIA
She will be sent home on atorvastatin 60mg. 

#HYPOTHYROIDISM 
Her TSH was found to be elevated at 7.9 and her home 
levothyroxine was increased from 50 to 62mg qday. Her PCP ___ 
need to continue trending TSH while outpatient. 
 #SEIZURE DISORDER
Initial concern that her symptoms potentially were related to 
seizure however no further concern and home medications were not 
changed. She arrived on lamotrigine 200mg BID and keppra 500 BID 
which she remained on. 

#GLAUCOMA 
No issues while inpatient. 

Transitional Issues:
[ ] PCP: trend TSH. Levothyroxine increased from 50 to 62.5mcg 
daily given TSH 7.9.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness and right 
sided weakness resulting from what we believe to be nonspecific 
sequela of cerebral infarction. You were not found to have a new 
stroke on MRI, however you have a history of residual problems 
from past stroke and your new symptoms seemed consistent with 
stroke. We believe that your new symptoms are likely secondary 
to your stroke risk factors and related to old stroke. We would 
like you to continue your current home meds and to continue 
following closely with outpatient neurology in order to best 
prevent further strokes. A stroke is a condition where a blood 
vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by 
a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are: high blood pressure, high 
cholesterol. 

We are not changing your home medications. 
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team

GI: benign PPI and bowel regime continued

Renal: renal function within normal limits.  She was gently 
diuresed to her preop weight of 65.7 Kg.

Hyponatremia: Na+ 12. With free water restriction it slowly 
trend ed up. Discharge Na 129. She was asymptomatic.

Endocrine: IV insulin and sliding scale for good blood sugar 
control.  Once taken PO medication her metformin and Glyburide 
were resumed.

Disposition: She was evaluated by the physical therapy service

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have L ankle fracture and was admitted to the orthopedic 
surgery service.  The patient was taken to the operating room on 
___ for ORIF L ankle, which the patient tolerated well (for 
full details please see the separately dictated operative 
report). The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable 
condition and after recovery from anesthesia was transferred to 
the floor.  The patient was initially given IV fluids and IV 
pain medications, and progressed to a regular diet and oral 
medications by POD#1. The patient was given perioperative 
antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine.  The patients home 
medications were continued throughout this hospitalization.  The 
patient worked with ___ who determined that discharge to rehab 
was appropriate. The ___ hospital course was otherwise 
unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable 
vital signs that were within normal limits, pain was well 
controlled with oral medications, incisions were 
clean/dry/intact, and the patient was voiding/moving bowels 
spontaneously. The patient is touchdown weightbearing in the 
left lower extremity, and will be discharged on Lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis.  The patient will follow up in two weeks per 
routine. A thorough discussion was had with the patient 
regarding the diagnosis and expected post-discharge course, and 
all questions were answered prior to discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT
=========================================================
___ chronically-ill male with T1DM, ESRD on HD, bilateral ___ 
DVT
s/p IVC filter ___ and on warfarin, L non-occlusive jugular
thrombus (___), R thalamic bleed in the setting of HTN
emergency w/ residual L hemiparesis (___), and recent
admission from ___ for MRSA bacteremia ___ PNA on 
vancomycin
with HD sessions (scheduled course through ___, who presents
from rehab with a 25-lb weight gain and worsening ___ edema on 
___.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=========================================================
# Dysphagia, s/p G-J tube placement ___
# Severe Protein Calorie Nutrition
Patient noted to have high aspiration risk over course for last
hospitalization, but decided to accept risks and trial pureed 
solids with nectar-thick liquids during prior hospitalization. 
Patient's G-J tube became clogged during admission. As patient 
was maintaining good PO intake and eating food was important to 
patient's GOC, the clogged G-J tube was pulled ___. On 
discharge, patient was eating solid diet.

# ESRD on HD, secondary to T1D 
Pre-admission HD sessions at facility were reported to have been 
limited by hypotension and tachycardia, and with an inability to 
increase UF as a result. Here, patient received hemodialysis 
through admission with ultrafiltration to remove excess volume. 
Repeat Echo showed recovered EF at 58%. By ___ patient did 
not appear volume overloaded on clinical exam. 

# HF w recovered EF (EF 45% ___ 
# Elevated troponins 
Patient presented with volume overload and elevated proBNP, 
consistent with HF exacerbation. Patient's discharge weight was 
66.3kg, and reported dry weight is 63kg. Admission weight was 
74.3kg. EKG w/o new ischemic changes, despite mild trop 
elevation. Infectious workup negative, other than ongoing 
aspiration. While here, a repeat Echo showed a recovered EF at 
58%. His metoprolol was uptitrated for better rate control, and 
his atorvastatin was continued. 

# Pneumonia 
# Recent MRSA Bacteremia 
# Leukocytosis
Patient had recent admission from ___ for MRSA bacteremia
___ PNA, and has been dosed with vancomycin with HD sessions
(scheduled course through ___. He presented with increased 
leukocytosis, and CXR consistent with worsened bilateral 
pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration. He received a few 
days of broad spectrum treatment, prior to return to his 
original Vancomycin course. Vancomycin was transitioned to 
linezolid ___, as vancomycin may have been contributing to 
eosinophilia (3.84 on admission). All antibiotics were stopped 
on day of discharge (___) as patient had completed course 
for hospital associated pneumonia.

# Anemia 
Hgb notably below baseline; 7.6 on admission, from discharge Hgb 
of 8.3. Had Hgb drop from 7.6 to 6.5 on ___. Anemia likely 
multifactorial, including acute suppression iso infection, and 
anemia of chronic disease from ESRD. Less likely GI bleed, as 
patient has had no complaints of melena or BRBPR. Patient was 
transfused for Hgb < 7 throughout admission. Hb was 7.8 at 
discharge.

# T1DM
Patient has very brittle T1DM, and presented in DKA on recent 
admission in ___. He is very sensitive to insulin and has had 
hypoglycemic episodes in the past. He was continued on home 
glargine 7U with Q6H insulin sliding scale for tube feeds on 
admission. He was transitioned to glargine 8U and insulin lispro 
2U with meals after he began to eat meals. He was discharge on 
glargine 8U with lispro 2U at meals.

# Hypoxia (resolved) 
Had new 2L O2 requirement in ED, after satting in low ___ on RA.
Most likely volume overload iso vs progression of pneumonia.
Resolved by time of arrival to floor. 

# Goals of Care 
A family meeting was held in which patient's family expressed a 
clear understanding that patient was seriously ill and that 
DNR/DNI status was consistent with the patient's goals. He 
himself confirmed these wishes to his providers as well. At end 
of hospitalization, patient filled out MOLST with DNR/DNI 
status. He would like to keep eating for comfort and understands 
the risks of aspiration and death. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
=========================================================
# Atrial Fibrillation and tachycardia
Patient presented with HR in 120s. Patient's home metoprolol 
dose was increased from 25mg q6h to 50 mg q6h.

# History of VTE
Complicated coagulation history. Patient had bilateral ___ DVT 
s/p IVC 
filter ___, L non-occlusive jugular thrombus (___), R 
thalamic bleed in the setting of HTN emergency w/ residual L 
hemiparesis (___). Patient was briefly subtherapeutic, and 
therefore bridged with a heparin gtt until therapeutic again. 
Patient was discharged on home dose of warfarin 2.5 mg with 
therapeutic INR of 2.5 at discharge. 

# GERD: 
Home Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H was continued.

# Mood: 
Home mirtazapine 15 mg PO QHS was continued. Sertraline 25 mg PO 
DAILY were held while patient was receiving Linezolid due to 
risk of serotonin syndrome. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================================================
#MRSA bacteremia s/p treatment
[ ] Surveillance blood cultures after HD on ___

#Hypertension
[ ] Uptitrate lisinopril as tolerated to goal SBP <130/80.

#Atrial fibrillation:
[ ] Uptitrated metoprolol to 50mg q6h while inpatient. If 
requires further rate control, could add diltiazem or consider 
amiodarone, with discussion with cardiologist.
[ ] Can consolidate Metop tartrate into Metop Succinate 200mg 
daily if tolerating well. 

#Diabetes mellitus
[ ] Insulin dose was increased to 8U glargine at baseline, 2U 
short-acting with meals, and sliding scale. Please titrate as 
needed.

#Depression:
[ ] Holding sertraline due to interaction w Linezolid (risk of 
serotonin syndrome) until ___, then ok to restart.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS  
======================  
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You came to the hospital from rehab because you had gained 25 
pounds of fluid and developed swelling in your legs. 

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- When you came to the hospital you were found to have symptoms 
and signs on an infection in your lung, likely related to 
swallowing food into your lungs. You underwent dialysis in the 
hospital to remove fluid from your body. You also received 
antibiotics to treat the infection in your lung. We removed your 
feeding tube because you preferred to eat food, even with the 
increased risk of infections in your lungs.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Continue to take all your medicines and keep your 
appointments.

We wish you the best!

MICRO DATA:
URINE CX (___): negative
.
STUDIES:
CXR (___): The suggestion of a small region of increased 
radiopacity in the left mid lung at the level of the anterior 
fourth rib, may correspond to a similar abnormality on the 
lateral view projecting over the posterior aspect of the mid 
thoracic spine. This could be a superimposition of normal 
shadows or alternatively a very small focus of consolidation in 
the left lung. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural 
effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. Oblique chest views 
might be helpful in determining whether the abnormality is real.
.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER (___): 
1. Echogenic micronodular liver with no focal abnormalities 
identified.
2. Reverse flow in the right portal vein up into the left portal 
vein. Patent umbilical vein.
3. Single small gallstone with no signs of cholecystitis.
4. Large amount of ascites.
5. No hydronephrosis.
.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old man with EtOH cirrhosis admitted with elevated 
creatinine.
.
# Acute renal failure - Creatinine was 3.1 on admission. No 
known history of kidney disease and PCP records showed that his 
creatinine had been 1.1 a few months ago. Diuretics were held. 
He received albumin and a fluid challenge overnight when he was 
admitted without any significant effect. Started midodrine and 
octreotide as well as daily albumin in case hepatorenal was 
playing a role. No new meds. No signs of obstruction and no 
hydronephrosis on ultrasound. Renal was consulted. Urine 
sediment with acanthocytes and possibly a couple red cell casts. 
UA with small amount of hematuria ___ RBC, ___ RBC on 
repeat). The renal team felt that his renal failure was likely 
due to renal hypoperfusion (could even be HRS) from combination 
of cirrhosis and aortic stenosis, with multiple recent large 
volume paracenteses. ___ also have underlying IgA nephropathy 
given proteinuria. Hep B/C serologies negative so not likely a 
GN related to those. Creatinine remained stable and he was 
discharged with the plan to follow-up with Renal as an 
outpatient for biopsy and further evaluation.
.
# Cough - Association with sore throat, rhinorrhea, similar sick 
contacts symptoms made a viral URI most likely. He remained 
afebrile without leukocytosis. A very small opacity in left lung 
was noted on CXR however given bacterial pneumonia was felt 
unlikely, he was not treated with antibiotics.
.
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis - Complicated by varices and recurrent 
ascites requiring large volume paracentesis. MELD 25. Most 
recent paracentesis on ___ with 9L removed, did not receive 
albumin. Diuretics were held as above for renal failure. 
Continued nadolol, MVI, folate. Discontinued lactulose as 
patient has no history of encephalopathy.
.
# HTN - Continued amlodipine.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia - Continued statin.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD #0 overnight, patient had high drain output and knee was 
flexed with drain clamped for 4 hours with appropriate effect.
POD #1, drain was discontinued. Dressing was changed per patient 
request as she felt she was developing a rash. No rash noted.
POD #2, patient complained of itchiness in morning.  A dose of 
Benadryl was given and the itchiness resolved. Patient cleared 
___ without further issues.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Aspirin 325 mg twice 
daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The 
surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision 
was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs 
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with no range of motion 
restrictions.

admission and any new medications and refills. 

3. Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.

4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do 
not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent 
this side effect.  Call your surgeons office 3 days before you 
are out of medication so that it can be refilled.  These 
medications cannot be called into your pharmacy and must be

Final Report 
INDICATION: ___ man with collapse, decreased right hand 
pulse, 
question dissection. 
  
COMPARISON: None. 
  
TECHNIQUE: MDCT data were acquired through the chest, abdomen 
and pelvis 
after the administration of 80 cc of IV contrast. Images were 
displayed in 
multiple planes. 
  
FINDINGS: The exam is limited by suboptimal contrast bolus 
timing. 
  
There is an extensive type-A aortic dissection extending from 
the aortic root, 
to the descending and abdominal aorta, to the level of the 
infrarenal 
abdominal aorta. Evaluation for carotid extension is severely 
limited by poor 
contrast bolus timing and streak artifact through the neck. The 
dissection at 
least extends into the proximal left subclavian and into the 
proximal right 
brachiocephalic artery. Approximately 1.2 cm distal to the right 

brachiocephalic origin, there is a 1.3 x 0.6 cm outpouching 
(300b:18) which 
may represent a pseudoaneurysm. Extension into the right common 
carotid 
cannot be assessed. The celiac, SMA and right and left renal 
arteries 
originate from the true lumen. The ___ from the true 
lumen. 
  
There is no hemopericardium. There is fat stranding within the 
mediastinum 
without frank extravasation. Numerous chest wall collateral 
vessels are 
noted.  
  
CHEST: There is dependent atelectasis plus aspiration at both 
lung bases.  
The remainder of the lungs are clear. The airways are patent to 
the 
subsegmental level. An endotracheal tube ends in the upper 
trachea.  
  
ABDOMEN: The liver parenchyma is homogeneous. The gallbladder is 
thin-walled 
and not distended. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are 
unremarkable. 
The kidneys enhance symmetrically. The stomach, small and large 
bowel are of 
normal caliber and appearance. 
  
PELVIS: Diffuse diverticulosis is seen throughout the colon. 
There is a 
right inguinal hernia (2:35) containing loops of small bowel 
with mild 
fecalization, but no wall thickening or adjacent stranding. 
There is no free 
pelvic fluid. There is no inguinal or pelvic adenopathy. The 
appendix is 
normal. 
  
BONE WINDOWS: There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes 
throughout 
the thoracolumbar spine. No concerning lytic or sclerotic 
lesions. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Extensive type-A dissection extending from the aortic root to 
the 
infrarenal abdominal aorta. The dissection extends into the 
proximal left 
subclavian and right brachiocephalic arteries. There is a small 
thrombosed 
pseudoaneurysm in the proximal right brachiocephalic artery. 
Evaluation for 
extension into the common carotid arteries is markedly limited 
by poor 
contrast bolus timing. Should further evaluation of the carotid 
arteries be 
necessary, neck CTA could be performed. 
  
2. Right inguinal hernia containing a loop of fecalized ileum 
without 
inflammation or wall thickening. 
  
3. Dependent atelectasis versus possible aspiration. 
  
4. Haziness of the mediastinal fat may be inflammatory although 
hematoma is 
not excluded. 
  
Findings were urgently conveyed to the ER physicians by Dr. ___ 
___ 
immediately after the completion of the scan by telephone on the 
morning of 
___ and discussed with ___ on the morning of 
___ @ 
9:55 am by Dr. ___.

There is no report history available for viewing. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presents with abdominal pain secondary to back pain 
and rapidly deteriorating mental status with left hemi-neglect. 
He was intubated for airway protection. CT of the head was 
negative, CTA of the chest showing diffuse type A dissection. 
Stat consult to cardiac surgery and vascular surgery was done.
The family discussed with ___ risks of surgery. The 
family were in agreement at having the pt extubated and allowing 
him to die, knowing that it is what Mr. ___ would want; they 
did not want to wait until his children, who live out of state, 
arrive. Ms. ___ does not want an organ donation or
an autopsy. ___ was taken off the ventilator and shortly 
thereafter pronounced dead. The appropriate post mortem agencies 
were contacted per hospital policy.

___:  EKG:  

Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Inferior myocardial 
infarction, age 
indeterminate. No previous tracing available for comparison.

___:  chest x-ray:

  
1. Enlarged aortic arch and extensively calcified aortic arch, 
worrisome for aneurysmal dilatation. If warranted by clinical 
situation, further evaluation could be performed with Chest CTA. 
 
  
2. Reticular pulmonary opacities, most compatible with chronic 
lung disease. 
  
3. Bibasilar atelectasis

___:  chest x-ray:

 
FINDINGS: New right internal jugular line tip is at lower 
SVC/cavoatrial 
junction approximately 3.2 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube 
courses below the diaphragm and ends into the body of the 
stomach and is appropriately positioned. Since prior radiograph 
acquired several hours apart, bibasilar atelectasis persists 
with interval worsening on the right side and unchanged on the 
left side. Small pleural effusion on the right side is similar. 
Upper lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size, 
mediastinal and hilar contours have stable appearance.

___:  EKG:

 Supraventricular rhythm at the upper limits of normal rate with 
P-R interval 
prolongation. Low amplitude P waves merged with the T wave. 
Cannot rule out atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block. RSR' pattern 
in leads V1-V2. Q waves in leads III and aVF - consider inferior 
myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing the rate is 
faster. The P-R interval is longer with a difference in the P 
wave which may be related to fusion with a T wave. 
Clinical correlation is suggested.  
TRACING #1

___:  ECHO:

 IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global systolic function. The left ventricle is 
compressed by a severely dilated and hypokinetic right 
ventricle. The RV apical function is relatively preserved which 
is a non-specific sign but could be due to pulmonary embolism. 
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation and at least moderate pulmonary 
hypertension.

___:  EKG:

Sinus bradycardia with sinus arrhythmia and P-R interval 
prolongation. 
Prolonged Q-T interval. Borderline low precordial QRS votlage. T 
wave 
inversions in leads VI-V4 and in the inferior leads. Slightly 
delayed anterior R wave progression - cannot exclude prior 
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ T wave inversion is 
more prominent in leads II and V3. RSR' pattern has resolved, 
likely due to changes in electrode placement. Anterior R wave 
progression has improved.An ongoing inferior and anterior 
ischemic process cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is 
suggested 

___:  chest x-xay:

Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Left lower lobe retrocardiac 
consolidation and ill-defined opacities in the right mid and 
lower lungs are stable, concerning for aspiration. There are no 
new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax or enlarging pleural 
effusions. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard 
position 

___:  x-ray of the abdomen:

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with resolving small-bowel 
obstruction from ___ with decreased gaseous distention of the 
small bowel and progression of oral contrast into the proximal 
colon.

___:  cat scan of abdomen and chest:

 Multifocal pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia within the right 
upper, middle, 
and lower lobes. 
  
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
  
3. Fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as 
aneurysmal 
dilatation of the right common iliac artery and a saccular 
aneurysm arising off the right internal iliac artery with 
significant mural thrombus. 
  
4. Dilatation of loops of small bowel within the left abdomen 
and pelvis.  
The degree of small bowel dilatation overall has generally 
decreased and this likely reflects a persistent ileus, although 
a partial small bowel obstruction is not entirely excluded. 
  
5. Enlarged right hilar lymph node presumably reactive. 
Following resolution of acute symptoms a follow-up Chest CT is 
recommended. 
  
6. Emphysema. 
  
7. Pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
  
8. Probably duodenal lipoma

___:  EKG:

Sinus bradycardia. P-R interval prolongation. Borderline low 
limb lead 
voltage. Mild Q-T interval prolongation. Early R wave 
progression. 
RSR' pattern in lead V1. Borderline intraventricular conduction 
delay.  
ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of ___ 
the Q-T interval is now shorter. Otherwise, unchanged.  
TRACING #1 

___:  EKG:

Probable sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. Since the 
previous tracing the rate has increased. Atrial ectopy is new. 
The QRS complex is narrower. ST-T wave abnormalities are less 
prominent.

___:  chest x-ray:

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the known 
multifocal 
pneumonia, with a maximum manifestation at the right lung base, 
is unchanged in extent and severity. Unchanged moderate 
cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. Unchanged monitoring and 
support devices. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.

___:  chest x-ray:

Compared to the prior radiograph, there has been no change. 
Right sided 
extensive opacities remain. Left-sided patchy opacities also 
remain. Moderate cardiomegaly and areas of atelectasis 
bilaterally is unchanged. Right-sided IJ terminates in the 
mid-to-distal SVC.

___:  chest x-ray:

Rotated lordotic positioning. Allowing for this, the 
cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is likely stable. There are patchy opacities at the 
right and left bases, similar, possibly minimally improved, 
compared with ___ at 5:46 a.m. Doubt CHF. No gross 
effusion.

___ 5:01 pm SPUTUM      Source: Endotracheal.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the ___ 
___ with gallstone ileus. He had a gastric tube placed, but 
was removed during transport.  He was hypoxic upon admission.  A 
___ tube was replaced with subsequent vomitting.  He 
was emergently intubated and taken to the operating room  on 
___ for exploratory laparotomy, ileotomy and stone 
extraction. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred 
to the intensive care unit for further care:

Posoperatively, the patient was hypotensive and required fluid 
boluses. A NICOM was placed that showed adequate cardiac output. 
He was then started on intermittent levophed, vasopressin, and 
dopamine.  As his hemodynamic status improved, the pressors were 
weaned off by HD# 5. The patient was also noted to have a 
troponin increase  to 0.8 and was intermittently bradycardic. He 
underwent an Echocardiogaram which showed left ventricular 
hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of >55%. He was seen by 
Cardiology who atributed the changes to demand ischemia. On HD#4 
the patient developed an arrythmia and there was concern for a 
pulmonary embolism.  A CTA was performed which was negative for 
a pulmonary embolism.  He otherwise had no cardiovascular 
issues.

During the hospital course, the patient required fluid 
resuscitation and became fluid overloaded.  As a result of this, 
he was difficult to ventilate and had to be paralyzed and 
required several ventilatory mode changes. He was started on a 
lasix drip to help decrease his overload.  This was discontinued 
after 48 hours because of an increase in his creatinine. He 
subsuequently auto-diuresised down to his dry weight. On HD #5, 
he was started on tube feedings and gradually advanced to his 
goal.   He was slowly weaned and extubated on POD#8. He was 
maintained on a face mask throught POD #9 and weaned to nasal 
cannula on POD #11.  He was placed on a 1 week course of zosyn 
and vancomycin for his aspiration pneumonitis.   His oxygen 
requirement slowly resolved.  He was evaluated by Speech and 
Swallow to determine his ability to safely swallow without 
aspiration.     

On HD #5, the patient was started on tube feedings and slowly 
advanced to goal.  He was evaluated by Speech and Swallow who 
advanced him to a soft solid diet.  By POD 10 he was on a 
regular diet and calorie counts were begun to measure the 
magnitude of his oral intake.  He was tolerating a regular diet 
upon discharge. 

He was transferred to the surgical floor on HD #13.  His vital 
signs have been stabie and he has been afebrile. His white blood 
cell count has normalized and his hematocrit has been stable.  
He was tolerating a regular diet.  He has been evaluated by 
physical therapy and recommendations made for discharge to an 
extended care facility where he can futhter regain his strength 
and mobility.

****Of note:  x-ray of the abdomen on ___ showed enlarged 
right hilar lymph node and recommendation per radiology for a 
repeat cat scan in the future.

Imaging:
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Pulmonary emboli in the subsegmental branches of the left 
lower lobe and 
anterior left upper lobe with no evidence of right heart strain 
or pulmonary 
infarction. 
2. New patchy consolidation in the dependent portion of the 
right upper lobe 
likely represents pneumonia or aspiration. Ground glass 
opacities in a 
bronchovascular distribution in the left upper lobe may 
represent multifocal 
pneumonia or significant aspiration event. 
.
CT Head:
IMPRESSION:  
1. No brain metastases identified.  
2. There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage; 
however, subtle 
subarachnoid hemorrhage cannot be excluded on this study due to 
circulating 
intravenous contrast. 
.
CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC 
line was 
removed. Status post right lower lobe resection with subsequent 
volume loss 
of the right lung. Presence of a minimal right pleural effusion 
cannot be 
excluded. 
  
No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No pulmonary edema. No 
pneumonia.  
Unchanged asymmetry of the tracheal course through the 
mediastinum. 
.
___:
IMPRESSION: Peroneal calf veins not visualized in either lower 
extremities.  
Otherwise, no DVT present 
.
CXR:
Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. Patient is 
status post 
right lower lobectomy. The lungs are grossly clear with the 
surgical clips 
projecting in the right medial upper hemithorax. Unchanged right 
apical 
pleural thickening and blunting of the right CP angle are likely 
postoperative 
changes. Aeration of the right lung has improved.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with history of SC lung cancer s/p RLL lobectomy ___, 
recent hospitalization with low back pain found to have new 
lesions in spine and hip, delerium, ARI improved with IVF, MSSA 
bacteremia/PNA discharged on Nafcillin to be completed ___, 
presented with sudden onset hypoxia found to have bilateral 
subsegmental PEs, PNA and fluid overlead.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# HYPOXIA: Initial deterioration was likely ___ PE and 
aspiration PNA. Patient was initially started heparin gtt then 
bridged to lovenox and was initially placed on Vanco/Zosyn. As 
patient became afebrile, he was placed on Augmentin and remained 
afebrile. ***LAST DAY OF ANTIBIOTICS WILL BE ON ___ Hypoxic 
continued despite adequate PE and PNA coverage; exam revealed 
hypervolemic state. Patient was diursed with IV lasix 20mg. 
Serum Bicarbonate started raising patient and diuresis 
terminated. Patient was briefly off oxygen however then 
restarted o2 at 2 liters. This remaining hypoxia was attributed 
to PE. Patient will remain on lovenox indefinitely. 
.
# LOWER EXTREMITY WEAKNESS/HIP PAIN/URINARY RETENTION: Symptoms 
were attributed bony metastasis. Patient started radiation 
therapy and will compelte treatments on ___. Patient was 
started on steroids to help with inflammation. Patient will 
remain on this dose of steroids until ___ then he can began 
taper (2mg Q12h for 3 days then 2mg Q24h then off). Outpatient 
oncology will reassess him to see if further treatments are 
necessary. Physical therapy saw patient and recommended 
rehabilitation for strength training. Foley holiday was 
attempted however patient continued to have retention of urine 
upto 1L. Foley was then replaced resulting in hematuria, likely 
___ trauma v. radiation cystitis. Hematocrit was stable and 
patient was hemodynamically stable. 
.
# HYPERTENSION: Patient was markedly hypertensive during this 
admission and amlodipine was started with better control of BP
.
# ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient had initial troponin leak on 
admission likely ___ tachycardia and PE; there was associated 
EKG changes. No changes made to medications and no further 
interventions were needed.
.
# ATRIAL FLUTTER: On initially presentation, patient was 
elevated HR to 120s however with treatment of PE and continued 
use of metoprolol, patient had HR returned to normal.

IMAGING:
========
___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
When compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, there is 
slightly 
increased interstitial opacity projecting over the right lower 
lung field 
which appears more conspicuous .  This may represent crowding of 
pulmonary 
vasculature due to decreased inspiratory effort however an early 
infectious or inflammatory process cannot be excluded.  There is 
otherwise no other areas of focal consolidation.  There is no 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is within normal limits.  There is no acute osseous 
abnormality or free intraperitoneal air under the diaphragm. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Slightly increased interstitial opacities in the right lower 
lung field may represent bronchovascular crowding secondary to 
decreased inspiratory effort however an early infectious or 
inflammatory process cannot be excluded, particularly in this 
patient with productive cough.

========================
Ms. ___ is a ___ history of asthma, PCOS, hypertension, G6PD 
deficiency, and PTSD, who recently presented to ___ 
with worsening shortness of breath treated with prednisone 
burst, now re-presenting with worsening shortness of breath and 
wheezing, admitted with asthma exacerbation and community 
acquired pneumonia. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Patient hypertensive and with headaches while hospitalized. 
Started on verapamil 120mg qd with some improvement in blood 
pressure and headaches. Will require close-follow up, especially 
once she completes the steroid taper as it was felt her steroids 
contributed to her hypertension. 
[ ] Patient discharged on steroid taper as follows: 50mg qd x2d, 
40mg x2d, 30mg x2d, 20mg x2d, and 10mg x2d. PCP should reassess 
respiratory symptoms and determine if a longer taper is 
necessary.
[ ] Pending tests: ___ Blood cultures x2- no growth to date.
[ ] Patient was tachycardic during admission to 100-120s. Was 
thought to be secondary to frequent albuterol use prior to 
admission and ultimately improved during the majority of her 
stay. Low risk for DVT/PE per Wells criteria and other vital 
signs remained stable. Please follow up at next PCP ___.
[ ] Patient had a significant headache during admission, with a 
known history of migraines. She required IV ketorolac, PO 
fioricet, and IV Compazine during admission. She was discharged 
with PO Compazine and ibuprofen. Further headache management 
should be considered in the outpatient setting. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
===============
#Asthma exacerbation
#?CAP 
Patient has a history of asthma and has approximately 5 
exacerbations per year with no prior intubations. She recently 
presented to ___ on ___ with worsening dyspnea, s/p 
inhalers and prednisone 50mg x5d completed ___ but without 
subjective improvement. She presented to ___ ED with severe 
dyspnea with diffuse wheezing on exam. She received 
methylprednisolone 125mg x1 in the ED and then was started on 
prednisone 60mg qd. There was question of new RLL infiltrate on 
CXR on admission concerning for pneumonia, which could possibly 
have been the trigger for her asthma exacerbation. She was 
afebrile and without leukocytosis on admission but did have a 
productive cough. Sputum culture was contaminated by upper 
respiratory flora. Influenza PCR was negative. Respiratory viral 
panel and culture were negative. She completed a 5-day course of 
Ceftriaxone and azithromycin for empiric CAP treatment prior 
discharge. There was some concern for PE in this young female 
with wheezing and tachycardia but had low risk per Wells 
criteria (see below), with ultimate improvement in her 
tachycardia for the majority of her hospitalization. She was 
continued on home Advair and received duonebs q6h. She was 
switched from her home albuterol to levalbuterol nebs q2h:prn 
given tachycardia, but was switched back to albuterol on 
discharge. Patient was discharged on steroid taper for 10 days 
(50mg qd x2d, 40 x2d, 30 x2d, 20 x2d, 10 x2d) and will follow up 
with her PCP prior to the end of the taper to assess symptom 
resolution. She also received guaifenison for cough. 

#HTN 
Patient hypertensive to 180s on admission. She is only on 
spironolactone at home. She was previously hospitalized in ___ 
for wide-ranging SBP to 180-190s, requiring nifedipine and was 
started on labetalol at that time. Neuro workup at that time 
with negative CTA/CTV. Subsequently had BP med overdose 
requiring dopamine in MICU during prior hospitalization. During 
hospitalization, her hypertension was felt to be related to 
steroids. She was continued on home spironolactone and received 
hydralazine prn. She was also started on verapamil 120mg qd for 
both hypertension and headache. BPs were improved with addition 
of verapamil and were 130-150s/70-90s on day of discharge. At 
her PCP follow up, please evaluate her blood pressures (given 
the prednisone will be tapering) and determine if Verapamil 
should be continued.

#Tachycardia 
Patient tachycardia to the 90-120s on admission. EKG showed 
sinus tachycardia. Differential included ___ albuterol (patient 
endorsed using albuterol frequently prior to admission) vs PE. 
There was lower suspicion for PE manifested as tachycardia and 
wheezing given recent high frequency of albuterol nebs and low 
risk per Wells criteria. Patient had no recent travel or 
immobilization, no history of DVT/PE, and no known 
hypercoagulable state. Her tachycardia improved during the 
majority of her hospitalization.

#Headache 
Patient presented with right sided headache since ED, no focal 
neurological deficits. Patient has history of migraines. No 
improvement with APAP, tramadol or ibuprofen so patient received 
ketorolac and Fioricet as well as IV Compazine as needed. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Hypokalemia - Continued on home K supplementation 

#PCOS - Continued on home spironolactone 100mg PO BID

#OSA - History of CPAP previously non-adherent.

Discharge:
___:05PM BLOOD CK-MB-2 cTropnT-<0.___ with prior history of cocaine abuse presents from jail with 
chest pain. 

#Chest Pain: Most likely costochondtritis versus other 
musculoskeletal pain. Pain is atypical for angina given lack of 
association with exertion, lack of improvement with nitro and 
reproducibility on exam albeit patient is at risk of CAD with 
history of cocaine use. CTA is unrevealing for aortic dissection 
or PE and troponin is negative x3 along with a normal surface 
ECHO which are reassuring. ECG shows submillimeter ST elevations 
that are concave up and may be normal variant. Patient was 
started on daily aspirin daily 81mg and pain was improved with 
tylenol and ibuprofen. Patient should continue to take ibuprofen 
as needed for pain anti-inflammatory effect.

#Hypophosphatemia: Patient was repleted with neutraphos.

#Psych: Continue home seroquel  

Transitional Issues:
-Patient was ruled out for MI with negative trop x3. EKG showed

Brief Hospital Course:
___ YOM with panhypopituitaryism presented to ___ with fever, 
sudden onset nausea/vomiting, syncope, and hypoxemia, found to 
have possible pneumonia on CXR.  He most likely had a viral 
illness and required stress-dose steroids, but was unable to 
tolerate PO due to inractable nausea/vomiting.  He likely 
experienced syncope from dehydration related to viral illness, 
nausea, vomiting.

# Panhypopituitarism, central adrenal insufficiency:  Patient 
presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; has been admitted 
with similar presentations.  Nausea and vomiting improved with 1 
dose IV steroids, and was able to tolerate oral steroids.  Home 
prednisone was increased to 15mg daily.  Patient was instructed 
to continue stress dose prednisone 15mg daily for duration of 
pneumonia treatment, patient has appointment with outpatient 
endocrinologist on ___, who was endocrinologist was updated 
on hospitalization.

# Fever, Hypoxemia, Healthcare associated pneumonia vs 
aspiration:  Patient reported respiratory illness ongoing for 
approximately 1 week.  Chest x-ray showed possible pneumonia.  
His CURB-65 score was 2, moderate severity.  Alternatively, he 
may have had aspiration event during vomiting / syncopal 
episode.  He recently traveled to ___, but given Wells Score 
of 0, suspicion for PE was low.  Started levofloxacin 750 mg 
daily for HCAP (___).  He was successfully weaned off of 
supplemental O2, and ambulatory sats remained in the high ___.  
Influenza A/B and urine legionella were negative.  Other 
infectious workup with pertinent negatives:  Urinalysis and 
urine culture negative.  Blood cultures NGTD at the time this 
note is written.

# Syncope:  Likely vasovagal in setting of vomiting and 
dehydration versus orthostatic hypotension in the setting of 
inability to take PO steroids.  Family denies abnormal movements 
to suggest seizure, awoke spontaneously with no residual 
deficits.  EKG showed RBB but no significant change from prior.  
Was monitored on telemetry overnight with no events recorded.

# Dizziness: Adrenal insufficiency vs vertigo (associated with 
movement and relieved with meclizine); orthostatics were normal, 
negative workup on prior admissions.  

# Anemia:  HCT has been mid 30's in past, most recently 31 
___, with normal iron studies. Rectal exam done and was 
found to be guaiac negative.  HCT was stable

# Hypertension: Quinapril was held given low/normal blood 
pressures during hospitalization, and possible contribution to 
syncope.  PCP was informed and may restart if needed.

# Chest pain:  Patient presented with atypical chest pain during 
last admission, ruled out for MI seen by cardiology, recommended 
outpatient stress test; History not consistent with cardiac 
etiology, may be GI (esophageal irritation, acid reflux)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
You were ___ to ___ for nausea, vomiting, and fever.  The 
nausea, vomiting, and dizziness that you experience periodically 
is most likely a result of low levels of steroids in your blood 
because your pituitary gland, which controls release of 
hormones, has been partially resected.  It is very important 
that you take prednisone as prescribed every day to prevent 
these symptoms.

You had fevers and your chest x-ray showed evidence of 
pneumonia, so we started you on an antibiotic called 
levofloxacin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Please see Dr. ___ Dr.
___ consult note from ___ for further details of 
the
HPI, PPHx, PMHx, Substance Use Hx, SHx.
 
Briefly, this is a ___ year old woman with history of chronic
headaches and dyspepsia who originally came to the hospital on
___ for sudden catatonic like symptoms in the setting of
topiramate overuse for treatment of chronic headaches. She was
transferred to neurology for workup of her catatonic features,
her EEG showed diffuse slowing, and her symptoms improved
significantly after a trial of lorazepam 2mg IM x 1. 

She was revisited by psychiatry consult services who felt that
she seemed to have new-onset psychotic processes, expressing
paranoia and emotional lability.

Upon arrival to the unit she stated she did not understand why
she was on the psychiatric ward. She was concerned about her
previous headaches and felt they were not adequately addressed
but expressed she had not had a headache for the past 2 days. 
She
did not express any complaints, though stated she felt better
when she sang, and sang church hymns through the remainder of 
the
interview.

After speaking with her husband who came to visit, he states 
that
she is still, at times, not at her baseline. He stated she is
sometimes confused and has difficulty concentrating. He does
acknowledge that she is significantly improved from when she was
first admitted.

 
Past Medical History:
Headaches
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SAFETY:  The pt. was placed on 15 minute checks on admission and 

remained here on that level of observation throughout.  She was 
unit-restricted.  There were no acute safety issues during this 
hospitalization.

LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC: 
Catatonia had resolved before admission with ativan. On 
admission, she endorsed depressed mood with neurovegetative 
symptoms including reduced sleep, interest, energy, 
concentration, and appetite. She exhibited transient psychotic 
symptoms including a paranoid delusion that somebody was coming 
to hurt her, and auditory hallucinations where she heard the 
voice of her cousin and her brother. On admission, pt was 
started on mirtazapine 7.5mg PO QHS, olanzapine 5mg PO BID, and 
lorazepam 1mg PO BID with 1mg PO Q6H prn. On this regimen, she 
improved significantly. Her mood improved, and her psychotic 
symptoms resolved. Whereas on admission she was significantly 
fixated on somatic symptoms, in which these complaints 
represented the ___ her focus, by the time of discharge, 
these complaints were only mentioned in passing. She has poor 
insight, and she does not wish to take medications after 
discharge, as she believes that taking medication will make her 
dependent on them for further functioning.
 

GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:

PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) GROUPS/MILIEU: pt was visible on the unit but did not attend 
many groups.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS:
Husband denied previous depression or psychosis.

diffuse disease, unchanged from the prior catheterization in 
___. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic arterial 
hypertension (154/61). 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No significant obstructive CAD. Patent OM stents. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old male with history of coronary artery 
disease and hypertension who presents with chest pain in the 
setting of a recent positive stress test.  
.  
# CORONARIES: Patient has known CAD, has prior BMS to OM1 in 
___. His recurrent chest pain is concerning for stuttering 
angina given his known disease and response to nitroglycerin. 
Report of his out-patient stress test (reportedly positive per 
patient) was not available for review at time of admission, but 
plans were already being made for repeat catherization given 
worsening symptoms in the setting of a good medical regimen. 
Cardiac enzymes were negative times three and no ischemic 
changes were seen on EKG. Cardiac catheterization was performed 
which revealed no significant lesions or stenosis.  Pt remained 
pain free throughout his hospitalization. He was instructed to 
continue his home cardiac medications as previously directed and 
follow up with his primary care physician within one week of 
discharge.
.  
# RHYTHM: Pt has no history of arrhythmias. Sinus bradycardia 
with 1st degree AV block is an old finding. Given pts known 
bradycardia and new history of dizziness and fatigue, pt was 
evaluated by the Electrophysiology team.  There was no 
indication for pacemaker placement during this admission.  Pt 
was discharged home with a holter monitor to observe the extent 
of his bradycardia. Pt will follow up with his primary care 
provider and cardiologist to determine the benefit of a 
pacemaker in the future.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
======================
CXR ___: Comparison to ___.  Decrease in extent 
of a pre-existing left pleural effusion.  Unchanged appearance 
of the right lung.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild retrocardiac 
atelectasis.  Unchanged fibrotic right upper lobe changes.  
Right PICC line is constant. 

ECHO ___: 
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters are 
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
prominent fat pad. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher and mild mitral 
regurgitation is now appreciated. Other findings are similar.

=========================
___ woman with a history of CHF (LVEF 70% in ___, on Bumex), 
Afib (on Apixiban), and HTN who presented with worsening 
shortness of breath over the past week and cough found to have R 
sided pneumonia and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure 
exacerbation requiring BiPAP, complicated by hypercarbic 
respiratory failure requiring intubation. Sputum culture grew 
Moraxella and was treated with ceftriaxone (___) and 
azithromycin (___). Patient was given steroids, d/c'ed 
after 3 days due to worsening delirium. Delirium improved after 
steroids were d/c'ed and with Seroquel.  Pt. with afib with RVR 
during hospitalization.  Started on metoprolol and amiodarone 
with improvement in rates.

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
=========================
#) ACUTE DECOMPENSATED DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: LVEF 70% in 
___. On admission, her exam was consistent with fluid overload, 
with elevated JVP and 2+ pitting edema in both legs. LVEF 55-60% 
on this admission. She was diuresed with 120 mg IV Lasix boluses 
and Lasix gtt. Patient was transitioned to her home Bumex prior 
to discharge. Of note, her Bumex had recently been increased as 
an outpatient but she was not aware of this increase and had 
continued at her previous dose, possibly leading to the present 
admission.

#) HYPOXIA/CAP: Patient presented with hypoxia, was likely due 
to CHF exacerbation and community acquired pneumonia. Although 
patient stated she had no history of asthma or COPD, she had 
episodes of wheezing and was given standing ipratropium nebs 
which improved wheezing and hypoxia. Patient was found to have R 
lobe pneumonia on CXR and sputum culture grew Moraxella. She was 
treated with 7 day course of Ceftriaxone. Due to worsening 
hypercarbia and wheezing, she was treated with prednisone for 
CAP, however prednisone was stopped after 3 days due to 
worsening delirium. Patient had aggressive pulmonary toilet for 
copious secretions and productive cough. Hypoxia had resolved 
prior to discharge.

#) ACUTE HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient had episode of 
agitation and altered mental status on first night of admission, 
was found to have pCO2 120 and pH 7.07. She was intubated for 
hypercarbic respiratory failure and treated with diuretics and 
antibiotics for pneumonia. She was extubated the next day 
(___). She had subsequent episodes of respiratory distress 
that resolved with BiPAP.

#) AFIB with RVR: At home patient took Apixiban 2.5mg BID and 
Diltiazem 180mg BID.  On this admission, pt. with RVR.  HRs were 
140s-150s during admission which was controlled with a diltiazem 
gtt.  She was started back on her PO diltiazem and started on 
metoprolol 100 XL.  She still had difficult to control rates.  
As such, patient was started on amiodarone with improvement.  
She eventually was transitioned back to PO medications and was 
discharged on Metoprolol succinate 100 XL daily, Diltiazem 120 
mg daily, and amiodarone. She was discharged on her home 
apixaban for anticoagulation.

#) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient had worsening delirium after 
extubation most likely due to steroids, scopolamine, and ICU 
hospitalization. The scopolamine patch and steroids were d/c'ed 
and patient improved slowly. She was started on 50 mg Seroquel 
at 4 pm and 10 pm daily for continued agitation and sundowning. 
Mental status improved prior to discharge and she was AAOX3.  
She was discontinued off of Seroquel with stable mental status 
for over 72 hours.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
=========================
#) GERD: 
- Continued home omeprazole 20 mg daily

#) CHRONIC PAIN
- Continued home Gabapentin 300mg qhs 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
# Discharge Weight: 72.9kg (standing, day of discharge)
# s/p CAP Course: Completed Ceftriaxone 7 days, Prednisone 3 
days
# Afib Outpatient Management:  Patient needs to follow up with 
Dr. ___ Dr. ___ from cardiology.
# Afib with RVR: Pt. with difficult to control ventricular rates 
in the setting of her illness.  She was started on metoprolol 
and amiodarone. Continued on dilt and apixaban.
# Amio:  Would consider discontinuing amiodarone now that 
patient is stable with rate-controlled Afib.  Otherwise, patient 
needs safety monitoring if she remains on Amiodarone long term.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ 
because you had shortness of breath and cough. You were having 
trouble breathing so you were placed on BiPAP machine and sent 
to the cardiac ICU. You were found to have a pneumonia and heart 
failure exacerbation causing fluid to accumulate in your lungs. 
You required a breathing tube and breathing machine for a short 
time to help you breathe during the beginning of your 
hospitalization. You were given medications to treat your 
pneumonia and medications to help remove fluid from your lungs. 
You were given steroids to help decrease inflammation in your 
lungs, but this caused you to be agitated and confused in the 
ICU. Your confusion improved off of the steroids. Your exercise 
tolerance decreased from your baseline, so you are being 
discharged to rehab before you go home.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team

Her blood pressure was then found to be low 70/40. The patient's 
typically BP runs in SBP ___ and there is always difficulty 
obtaining accurate BP's. Because of this the patient was kept in 
clinic for gentle fluids with the goal of returning her SBP to 
mid 80's. She was also given decadron in the chance that she was 
having a reaction to erbitux. As her blood pressure did not 
increase adequately, it was decided to admit her. In addition, 
she was drowsy in clinic - ___ to Benadryl?, but was becoming 
increasingly alert as the benadryl wore off.  
.  
The patient now states that her mental status is greatly 
improved, at baseline, ""feels normal"". She also reports that she 
has increased the amount of fluid she removes in PD in order to 
dec peripheral edema. In addition, she missed her midodrine 
doses today. She also notes that yesterday she had poor PO 
intake secondary to the heat and mild nausea. Denies any 
vomting, no chills, no fever, minimal diarrhea.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with a h/o schizoaffective disorder and 
hypothyroidism who presented with dizziness and was found to be 
hypercalcemic. The following issues were investigated during 
this hospitalization:
  
1. Dizziness: Onset of symptoms correlates with initiation of 
Aricept for short-term memory loss and this medication has been 
associated with dizziness. Patient received IVF upon arrival for 
hypercalcemia but was never found to be orthostatic. Aricept was 
held while in house with improvement in symptoms. Head CT 
unremarkable as was neuro exam. Patient was discharged with home 
___. She will not continue on Aricept. 
  
2.  Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of elevated PTH since 
___ with intermittently elevated calcium values. Calcium > 11 
on admission, but responsive to IVF. Calcium and vitamin D 
supplements discontinued but bisphosphonate continued. Endocrine 
consulted given concern for Lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism. 
24 hour urine calcium was low and consistent with 
Lithium-induced disease and not likely necessitating surgical 
intervention. Still, further work-up was deferred to the 
outpatient setting. Lithium was decreased, but maintained as the 
endocrinopathies are generally not reversed with stopping 
Lithium and mood-stabilization remains of concern. She will f/u 
her lithium levels with her outpatient psychiatrist Dr. ___. 
She will also f/u as an outpatient with endocrinology.

3. Diabetes Insipidus: Suggested by mildly elevated Na and 
chloride, in the setting of endocrinopathies in a patient on 
long-term Lithium. Patient was started on Amiloride at the 
recommendation of the endocrinology consult, with improvement in 
electrolyte derrangements. Patient was otherwise encouraged to 
remain hydrated. She will be discharged on amiloride. 
  
4. Schizoaffective d/o: Psychiatry was consulted given concern 
for suicidal ideations and depression as well as for guidance 
for Lithium. Patient was initially on a ___, requiring 
that she remain hospitalized with intention to be transferred to 
a psychiatric facility. However, as her hospitalization 
continued and her metabolic derrangements were corrected, her 
mood improved. The section was eventually lifted and the patient 
was restarted on Lithium at a lower dose with outpatient 
follow-up with her psychiatrist. 
  
5. Dementia: Per patient's outpatient psychologist, 
neuropsychological testing showed significant memory impairment 
and MRI showed vascular disease, suggesting a possible etiology 
of dementia. Patient had been started on Aricept as an 
outpatient, but this was held given the complaint of 
lightheadedness that started after initiation of medication. 

6. Hypothyroidism: Patient was maintained on outpatient 
Levothyroxine.

7. Osteoporosis: Calcium and Vitamin D were held given elevated 
calcium and PTh on presentation, though Alendronate was 
continued. 

8. Hyperlipidemia: Patient was maintained on outpatient statin. 

9. Leukocytosis: Chronic problem of unclear etiology. No obvious 
source of infection. ___ trended down during this 
hospitalization and thus work-up was not pursued.

follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen and evaluated for left hand weakness and 
lightheadedness, which was felt to be due to a new medication 
you started - Aricept. This medication has been stopped. 
Additionally, you were noted to have an elevated calcium, which 
was due to a hormone problem called hyperparathyroidism. This 
hormone problem is likely due to Lithium, which you take and 
NEED to continue to take to control your mood. However, your 
Lithium dose has been decreased. Since your walking was unsteady 
but improved when you were discharged, you will have home ___ 
care. 

Take all of your medications as directed. Your Aricept, calcium 
and vitamin D have been stopped and your Lithium has been 
decreased. You were also started on a new medication, Amiloride, 
to help control your sodium level. It is important to stay very 
well hydrated.

Keep all of your follow-up appointments. They are listed below. 
Once you are discharged, you have an appointment with endocrine 
at 3PM today. It is very important that you keep this

Final Report 
HISTORY:  ___ male with fevers and right lower quadrant 
tenderness.   
  
COMPARISON:  Same day CT of in ___.   
  
TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the 
pubic 
symphysis after administration of oral contrast.  IV contrast 
was not 
administered.  This examination was repeated since a CT 
performed at 12:00 in 
order to better visualize the appendix.  Axial images were 
interpreted in 
conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.   
  
FINDINGS: 
  
Coronary artery calcifications are similar to prior.  Bibasilar 
atelectasis is 
unchanged.  5 mm left lower lobe nodule should be followed as 
previously 
recommended.  No pleural or pericardial effusion.   
  
ABDOMEN:   
  
Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs is limited by lack of 
IV contrast 
administration.  The unenhanced appearance of the liver, 
gallbladder, intra 
and extrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal 
glands is normal.  
There is minimal asymmetric right perinephric stranding and 
thickening of 
Gerota's fascia.  The ureters have a normal course and caliber. 
No calculi are 
seen within the kidneys or ureters, and no hydronephrosis is 
present. 
  
The stomach is normal.  The small and large bowel have a normal 
course and 
calibur.  The appendix is not dilated and the base of the 
appendix contains 
oral contrast, though the remainder of the appendix does not 
fill with oral 
contrast. No stranding is noted about the appendiceal tip. 
  
Right retroperitoneal stranding extending from the right lateral 
conal fascia 
along the right iliac vessels is unchanged and nonspecific. No 
focal fluid 
collection is present.  No retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  The 
unenhanced appearance of the portal and intra-abdominal systemic 
vasculature 
is unremarkable.  No abdominal wall hernia, pneumoperitoneum, or 
free 
intraperitoneal fluid. 
  
PELVIS:  The bladder contains a Foley catheter.  The terminal 
ureters are 
normal.  The prostate gland is unremarkable.  No pelvic 
side-wall or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy. No free pelvic fluid or inguinal hernia. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion 
concerning for 
malignancy.  Retrolisthesis of L5 on S1.  Mild multilevel 
thoracolumbar spine 
degenerative changes.   
  
CT Abd and Pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Minimal asymmetric right perinephric stranding and 
thickening of Gerota's 
fascia, which can be seen with pyelonephritis. Clinical 
correlation with 
urinalysis recommended. 
  
2.  Unchanged right retroperitoneal stranding extending along 
the right iliac 
vessels, non-specific. Findings could relate to urinary tract 
infection.   
  
3.  Normal appendix.   
   
4.  5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule should be re-assessed 
in 12 months 
if there is low risk of lung malignancy or in ___ months there 
is high risk. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hyperthyroidism on methimazole, Kawasaki's on warfarin, 
presenting with one week of intermittent fevers, lethargy, and 
RLQ pain, found to be in septic shock of unclear etiology:

# Septic shock ___ pyelonephritis: The patient meet SIRS 
criteria with fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, tachypnea, also 
hypotensive with likely source urinary given concerning UA 
(RBC-4, WBC-93, no epi's) and perinephric/retroperitoneal 
stranding on CT.  The patient was bolus 6L of NS and started a 
levophed gtt in the ED.  A central line was placed in the ED.  
The CVP was resusitated to >12, and MAP remained >65 on 
levophed.  His BP quickly improved and he was weaned from the 
levophed gtt.  He was initially given vancomycin and zosyn in 
the ED, which was narrowed to cefepime on arrival to the FICU.  
He developed a morbilliform rash after recieving vancomycin and 
zosyn in the ED.  He remained off pressors for over 48 hour and 
was admitted to a medical floor bed.  After 3 days, his 
antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin.  Blood and Urine 
cultures had no growth to date at that time. The patient was 
discharged on 7 day additional days of Levofloxacin for a full 
14d treatment for pylenonephritis due to septic shock.

# ___: Cr 1.9 in ED secondary to shock, which resolved to 
baseline after fluid resusitation.

# Hyperthyroidism: The patient was followed by endocrinology 
will inpatient after a recent diagnosis of Grave's Disease.  He 
was continued on his home propranolol, but the home dose of 
methimazole was held.  The patient will need to follow up with 
endocrinology with 1 week of discharge.

# Kawasaki's disease: He was continued on his home coumadin and 
quinapril.  An Echo was obtained that revealed a normal EF with 
mild aortic valve stenosis. The patients INR on d/c was 3.7 
given interaction with Coumadin. The patient will hold his 
Coumadin for 2 nights and have his INR checked on ___ at 
the ___. 

# Alcohol use: He denies a history of withdrawal, DTs, or 
seizures in previous hospitalizations.  e was initially started  
on a CIWA, but was discontinued after not scoring for the 
duration of his hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old patient with a history of 
retroperitoneal lipoma and abnormal uterine bleeding who is 
transferred from an OSH due to massive pulmonary embolism. 

#Massive Pulmonary Embolism: Pt was transferred from outside 
hospital, where a CTA chest showed pulmonary embolism. Given 
syncope x2 prior to admission, echocardiographic signs of RV 
failure, elevated proBNP (1552) and troponin T (0.03), this PE 
is classified as massive. Initially, patient was hemodynamically 
stable at rest with labile hemodynamics on minimal exertion. Pt 
received tPA via EKOS catheter x 2 on ___ for directed lysis 
of clot. Pt is now hemodynamically stable. Pt on heparin gtt 
during admission; warfarin initiated on ___ (received 5mg). 
NOACs were considered, but due to insurance issues and patient 
preference, warfarin was chosen. INR on discharge of 1.1; pt 
will go home with lovenox for bridging until therapeutic on 
warfarin.

#Abnormal uterine bleeding: Has been ongoing for year but 
slightly worse recently, for which she was started on 
norethindrone. Pelvic ultrasound showed fibroid uterus with 
blood in endocervical canal, normal ovaries, no free air. Gyn 
saw patient, recommended hysterectomy. Pt not interested in 
hysterectomy at this time, will f/u with gyn as an outpatient. 
Bleeding is minimal at this time, and remained stable on heparin 
gtt and with tPA.

NEURO: AAOx3, CN ii-xii grossly intact, gait deferred 

 
Pertinent Results:
Chest X-ray 
___
FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are low. 
Streaky 
opacity at the lung bases likely due to atelectasis. There is 
stable 
eventration of the right hemidiaphragm. Increased density in the 
retrocardiac area and seen laterally at the left lung base are 
concerning for infectious process. There is calcification of the 
aortic knob, unchanged with a slightly tortuous aorta. Heart 
size is mildly enlarged with prominent left atrium.  There is no 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION: Increased patchy opacities at the left lung base 
concerning for pneumonia/aspiration. 

Head CT
___
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, large areas 
of edema, 
large masses or mass effect. Periventricular white matter 
hypodensities is 
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. There is 
preservation of normal gray-white matter differentiation. The 
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration given 
the patient's age. 
Soft tissues of the orbits and nasopharynx are within normal 
limits. The 
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No 
fractures 
are identified. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. No acute hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Altered mental status: Initially concerning for stroke or 
bleed given history of anticoagulation and recent fall (though 
denied hitting head), however head CT did not demonstrate any 
bleed. Neurology was consulted in the emergency room and 
evaluated the patient. Based on his fever and chest x-ray 
findings, it was felt that his symptoms represented metabolic 
encephalopathy secondary to his febrile infection.
His mental status improved during his admission, and his 
neurologic examination remained non-focal.
<br>
#) Fever: Urine analysis not consistent with urinary tract 
infection, with culture negative for 24 hours. Chest x-ray was 
concerning for pneumonia at the left base. No other localizing 
symptoms or findings on examination. Patient was given 
ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the emergency room along with 
acetaminophen. He remained afebrile after that time, without any 
leukocytosis.
- He should continue azithromycin for 2 more days, and 
cefpodoxine 200 mg Q12 hours for 4 additional days.
- Blood cultures were pending at time of discharge, but were 
negative. Final cultures should be followed up from 
rehabilitation.
<br>
#) Atrial fibrillation: Patient's INR was elevated at time of 
admission, so his warfarin was held. He is not on any 
rate-controlling agents at home and had good rate control (high 
40's to 60's) during his admission.
- His INR should be check day after discharge, and warfarin 
resumed and adjusted accordingly.
<br>
#) Hypertension: His blood pressure medications were held 
initially to monitor for any hypotension given altered mental 
status and febrile state, they were resumed day of discharge 
when his systolic pressure was 160 in the morning.
<br>
#) Hyperlipidemia: Continue pravastatin
<br>
#) Renal insufficiency: Baseline values in our system are 
varied, 1.1-1.3 or 1.4. FeUrea was 36%, which was on the cut-off 
for being consistent with pre-renal etiology. His function 
remained stable slightly above baseline at 1.4-1.5 during 
admission. He was encouarged to take PO's during his first day, 
and his home medications werer re-started on day two. Given 
small blood seen in urine analysis, CK was checked to evaluate 
for rhabdomyolysis, which was 308.
<br>
#) Anemia: Patient had mild normocytic anemia during his stay. 
Iron studies, B-12, and folate were pending at time of discharge 
and may be followed up on an outpatient basis.
<br>
#) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient's blood sugars were mildly 
elevated during his admission (100-120's), but he was not 
treated, as wished to avoid hypoglycemia.
<br>
#) Osteoporosis: Continued vitamin D, calcium, and alendronate.
<br>
#) Status-post fall earlier in week: Patient was evaluated by 
physical therapy, who felt a short stay at rehabilitation was 
appropriate.

sotalol, and performed a procedure to stop the afib (this 
procedure is cardioversion).

You will need to keep taking the sotalol twice daily at home. 
You will stop the diltiazem you were taking, as well as the 
torsemide. You will keep taking the apixiban for blood thinner. 
You will also start Lasix twice daily, spironolactone daily and 
lisinopril daily.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. ___ noted a ""blood blister"" on his abdomen many years 
ago
which resolved on its own.  Then, approximately a year prior to
presentation, this started to grow again and bled occasionally.
He was referred by his PCP to dermatology where he saw ___, NP, on ___ with a 2 x 2
centimeter inflamed plaque with a central ulcer on the right
abdomen noted.  Biopsy revealed nodular melanoma, present at
peripheral and deep margins, at least 7.5 mm deep, at least
___ level 4, ulcerated, 29 mitoses per millimeter squared,
absent lymphovascular and perineural invasion on the original
pathology though the specimen was reviewed in our cutaneous
oncology conference and felt to show lymphovascular invasion. 
The patient was referred here for further management.  He went 
on
to have a wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy on
___.  This showed residual melanoma to 11 mm depth, 
2
of 6 recovered lymph nodes with micrometastases.

Initial staging scans on ___ revealed metastatic disease 
in
the left arm, right peritoneum, right adrenal, and left
infrahilar lymph node consistent with metastatic disease.  Brain
MRI showed no CNS metastases.  He underwent FNA of the left arm
nodule on ___ by Dr. ___ melanoma. 

Admitted to ___ with worsening SOB on ___, found 
to
have a PE, put on anticoagulation but developed abdominal wall
hematoma so, IVC filter placed. He has a history of developing 
GI
bleed while on anticoagulation in the past for atrial
fibrillation.

Was initially considered for Clinical Trial but could not be
enrolled due to elevated LFTs ( likely in the setting of acute
heavy alcohol use). 

Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks started on ___. 
Progression seen on scans on ___, therefore treatment
transitioned to ipi/nivo.

He completed 4 cycles Ipi/Nivo with good response and was
transitioned to nivolumab monotherapy. He was subsequently
hospitalized with adrenal failure and was found to have
metastatic disease to the brain. 

Neurosurgery was completed ___. Subsequent imaging revealed
ongoing abnormalities in the resection base so received CK
radiation to the site from ___.
  
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
Gastric bypass
Shoulder arthritis, rotator cuff injury awaiting surgery

to preferable bleeding risk profile. H/H stable after initiation 
of anticoagulation. 

#Concern for cellulitis
Received IV cefazolin 1g x2 in the ED for presumed cellulitis of 
LLE. Exam notable for mild erythema and ulceration of LLE with 
clear discharge, pain, and swelling which could be related to 
DVT but will continue empiric non-purulent cellulitis treatment 
for now with plan for Cephalexin 500mg QID to complete a 10 day 
course (end date ___. 

#Weakness
Pt reports weakness a fall ~2 weeks ago while on treadmill. He 
was referred for physical therapy as an outpatient at home. 

#Melanoma
Pt has stage IV BRAF WT melanoma s/p resection of abdominal mass

IMAGING:
CARDIAC CATH ___:
Hemodynamics (see above):
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA: 
LAD:  90% proximal, 100% mid
LCX:  40% proximal, 99% distal with patent stent in midvessel 
and
occluded OMs
RCA:  100% proximal
SVG-:  radial to OM patent, vein to PDA with 75% in-stent
restenosis, vein to diagonal known patent
LIMA-LAD:  not injected but known 80% in LAD beyond graft
Other: 

Assessment & Recommendations
 1. Will discuss options after review prior films with probable
PCI of restenosis of PDA graft and PCI of distal circumflex next
week.  Both supply small territories.

CARDIAC CATH ___:
Hemodynamics (see above):
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA: 
LAD:  known 80% proximal, 100% mid
LCX:  known diffuse up to 60% with patent stent in mid vessel 
and
complex ___ distal with occluded OMs
RCA:  known ___ proximal
SVG-:  diagonal patent, vein to PDA with only 30% in-stent
restenosis after IC nicardipine which is much improved compared
with angiography 3 days ago, radial to OM2 known patent
LIMA-LAD:  LAD with 70% beyond anastomosis with diffusely small
caliber distal vessel
Other:  Aortogram shows patent vein to diagonal and patent 
radial
to OM2

Interventional details
After IC nicardipine administration showed improvement in distal
PDA graft, intervention considered no longer necessary on that
area.  PCI of distal LAD beyond LIMA and PCI of distal 
circumflex
would both be difficult but could be considered if recurrent
angina or markedly positive ETT.

Assessment & Recommendations
 1. Continue med Rx.
 2. Consider PCI if recurrent angina.

CXR ___:
Normal lung volumes. Normal appearance of the mediastinum and 
the hilar
structures. Sternotomy wires of the CABG show correct alignment. 
Borderline
size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild elongation of the 
descending aorta.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No pleural 
effusions.

EXERCISE STRESS TEST ___:
Fair exercise tolerance. Atypical/non-anginal type symptoms
with no ischemic ST segment changes at the achieved level of 
work.
Nuclear report sent separately.

CARDIAC PERFUSION STUDY ___:
1. At level of exercise achieved, no myocardial perfusion 
defects. 
2.  Normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 54%.  
3.  Mildly prominent
right ventricle.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with a PMHx significant for rheumatoid 
arthritis, chronic pain, and significant cardiac history 
including CABG in ___ and PCI 6 months ago presents with severe 
chest pain with associated arm/jaw pain without EKG changes or 
troponin leak.  

ACUTE ISSUES:
#Chest pain: Patient had history of CAD s/p CABG and PCIs with 
significant chest pain at rest without EKG changes and negative 
troponins. He underwent catheterization on ___ which showed 
extensive disease in the LAD, Lcx and RCA. No intervention was 
performed given that the previous films were not available for 
review and it was unknown whether the lesions were new or old. 
He underwent repeat catheterization on ___ without 
interventions given poor anatomy unchanged from prior PCI. He 
was continued on aspirin, plavix, metoprolol and atorvastatin. 
He continued to have significant chest pain at rest and with 
minimal exertion without EKG changes. He was started on imdur, 
amlodipine and ranolazine without much improvement in chest 
pain. He had a stress test and nuclear study which showed no EKG 
changes or evidence of ischemia. Chest pain was not felt to be 
due to cardiac ischemia given these findings. He was discharged 
with plans to follow-up with his PCP/cardiologist for further 
management. 
 
#Chronic pain: Patient has sciatica and multiple joint surgeries 
in addition to chronic inflammatory diseases. He is on many pain 
medications as an outpatient and had a significant requirement 
for narcotics while hospitalized. He also endorsed symptoms of 
withdrawal when he did not get his opioid medications. He 
complained mostly of back and chest pain, which was treated with 
home medications of oxycodone, oxycontin and gabapentin. He was 
seen by the chronic pain service given that patient's chest pain 
was at times reproducible who recommended increasing gabapentin, 
starting volteran gel and using a lidocaine patch. Patient's 
chest and back pain improved with these interventions. 
 
#Anxiety: Patient was continued on home clonazepam, trazodone, 
benadryl prn.   

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# ___ edema: Patient was continued on home furosemide. 

#Rheumatoid arthritis/ulcerative colitis: Patient is on 
methotrexate and prednisone at home. He had no flares of joint 
pain or diarrhea during this hospitalization. He was continued 
on home prednisone and methotrexate was held.   

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient was started on Imdur 30mg PO daily, amlodipine 5 mg 
daily, ranolazine 1000 mg BID
- increased gabapentin to 900 mg TID
- started acetaminophen 1000 mg q8h, voltaran cream and

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ with chest pain. Your EKG was 
unchanged from prior. You had a cardiac cath which was unchanged 
from your prior cath about six months ago. Given that this was 
unlikely to be accounting for your chest pain, there was no 
intervention. You were continued on your home medications, but 
still had a few episodes of chest pain. A new medication was 
added to help with this pain. You should continue to take all 
your home medications as prescribed. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you,

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ YO homeless male who presented with acute 
diarrhea and was admitted for rehydration.  

# Diarrhea: Pt has acute onset of diarrhea, fever, nausea, and 
anorexia, most likely infectious. Given time of year and 
exposure to sick contacts in crowded shelter Viral 
gastroenteritis was felt to be the most likley etiology. Stool 
studies were sent regardless. He was placed on a bland diet and 
treated symptomatically with loperamide, IVF prn, and tylenol 
for abdominal pain. On HD2 his diarrhea had improved, he had 
remiained afebrile with stable VS and was tolerating bland diet 
with minimal abdominal pain. C diff and HIV were both negative 
as were O&P x2. There was no salmonella, shigella or Ecoli 
OH:571. Studies for yersinia, vibrio and cryptosporidum were 
pending at the time of discharge and should be followed up by 
his PCP as the results become available.
.
. 
# Sinus tachycardia: Likely from volume depletion. Pt received 
5L NS in the ED and an additional 1L of NS once on the floor. 
His tachycardia subsequently resolved and his VS remined stable 
throughout the course of his hospitalization.
 
.  
# Chronic cough: CXR no evidence of pneumonia. Pt does have post 
nasal drip which could contribute to chronic cough. He was not 
hypoxic nor was he ever in distress. This will need to be 
adressed by his PCP. 
.  
# Depression:  
COntinued home medications. He will follow up with his 
depression support group.
.  
# Homeless: SW saw and evaluated patient and have made 
arrangments for temporary housing following discharge. Please 
refer to their note for details.
.
# Hx of BRBRP: Pt denies current bleeding. But had seveal 
episodes of blood streaked toilet paper during his admission. 
His HCT remained stable. Thought secondary to hemmorhoids vs 
irritation from frequent stooling. Pt's last C-scope was ___ years 
ago in ___ and was reportedly normal. He should follow up 
with his PCP for appropriate screening/ further workup.

Diverticulitis: Pt was diagnosed with divertitulitis intially as 
an outpatient, on ___. He had a CT scan at that time. A repeat 
CT on ___ (day of admission), showed progression of disease, 
patient now with microperforation. Surgery was consulted given 
this is complicated diverticulitis. He was put on broad spectrum 
antibiotics, intially zosyn and vancomycin. Vancomycin was 
eventually discontinued given low suspicion for gram positive 
infection on bowel. Patient was on bowel rest, NPO, and on TPN. 
A PICC line was placed for the TPN and IV antibiotics since he 
has poor venous access. Patients abdominal pain improved slowly. 
Once minimal, he was started on a liquid diet, which he 
tolerated, and this was slowly advanced to regular diet. TPN was 
tapered off. Prior to discharge, the patient was switched to PO 
augmentin, which he is to continue for a total of 3 weeks of 
abx, so until ___. He was also seen by nutrition several 
times, including once with his HCP present, to go over changes 
in his diet given his new diagnosis of diverticulitis. 
.
Diarrhea: Patient had small amounts of diarrhea during 
hospitaliztion, which came back positive for clostridium 
dificile. He has a history of difficult to control seizures, so 
flagyl is avoided since it lowers seizure threshold. He was 
started on vancomycin PO 250mg q6h, which he was will continued 
until ___, 2 weeks after augmentin course is done. 
.
Agitation: Patient was agitated in the ED, likely has lower 
seizure threshold given diverticulitus. This may also be 
delerium from infection. On suggestion by epilepsy service, he 
was put on ativan standing and PRN
.
Hx of seizures: patient has significant hx of seizures, has 
vagal nerve stimulator since ___. At this time, he likely has 
lower seizure threshold secondary to infection. He was followed 
by the epilepsy service while in the hospital. Most of 
medications were switched to IV during hospitalization while he 
was NPO. He was continued on the home meds as listed. Levels of 
carbamazipine and phenytoin were checked almost daily and 
bolused and adjusted as needed. He was also placed on standing 
ativan 1mg BID while infected. Once tolerating PO, he was 
switched back to PO meds, and discharged on the medications he 
was admitted on. The Ativan was tapered off on discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was medflighted from the scene and was taken emergently 
to the operating room, discovering a GSW through stomach and 
into jejunum, with injury to the transverse mesocolon, jejunum 
distal to ligament of treitz as well as a retroperitoneal 
hematoma

anterior and posterior gastrostomy and jejunostomy.  These were 
repaired primarily.  He was also noted to have a small 
retroperitoneal hematoma.  Postoperatively, he did well and was 
transferred to the floor from the trauma ICU on POD 1.   

On a CT scan with contrast done to locate the bullet he was 
noted to have an 8 x 10mm left renal pseudoaneurysm.  He was 
seen by vascular surgery, but no intervention was required.  

Complicating the pt's stay was the development of fevers and 
left lobe consolidation thought to be secondary to aspiration 
pneumonia.  He was started a 10 day course of levaquin.  By time 
of discharge, he was afebrile, tolerating a regular diet, pain 
was controlled with po pain medicine, and able to ambulate.  He 
was discharged home to his sister's house.  He will follow up in 
the trauma clinic but will most likely return to ___ after 
that.  

Several staples were removed prior to discharge.  The incision 
was clean, dry, and intact without signs of infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to pre-op on ___. Pt was 
evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room for 
laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. There were no adverse 
events in the operating room; please see the operative note for 
details. Pt was extubated, taken to the PACU until stable. She 
was then transferred to ___ 9. On POD #1, Patient had an acute 
desaturation requiring 70 percent o2 via face mask and was 
transferred to TSICU. A chest X-ray showed low lung vol, 
moderate cardiomegaly, signs of mild fluid overload. A CT/CTA 
was done which ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed b/l 
pleural eff, apical findings concerning for bronchopneumonia. 
The patient was managed with a combination of O2 via facemask, 
chest ___, duonebs, and encouragement of Incentive spirometry. 
She soon reduced her O2 requirements to 2L via nasal cannula and 
was stable enough to be transferred out of the TSICU. Since that 
point she resumed the ___ bariatric gastric bypass pathway. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a PCA and then 
transitioned to oral Roxicet once tolerating a stage 2 diet. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable thereafter from a 
pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good 
pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO.  An upper GI 
study (POD1) were both negative for a leak, therefore, the diet 
was advanced sequentially to a Bariatric Stage 3 diet, which was 
well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely 
monitored.  JP output remained serosanguinous throughout 
admission; the drain was removed prior to discharge. Her insulin 
regimen was adjusted to reflect her lower postoperative blood 
glucose levels.
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.

   Ms. ___ presented with nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, fever. 
Although severity of these symptoms reportedly increased in the 
setting of GCSF initation (x4 days), she reports diarrhea 
occurring even beforehand. Admit WBC was elevated 54.3, lactate 
2.1 - but in the setting of GCSF.
    CT A/P showed evidence of mild enteroproctocolitis. Workup 
of her symptoms included the following: Flu: neg, Stool cdiff, 
salmonella/shigella/campylobacter were neg, CMV VL was 
undetectable.  Of note, CXR was negative. 
    To evaluate whether the G-CSF may play a role in her 
symptomology, hematology was consulted.  They felt that her 
constellation of symptoms were not attributable to the G-CSF.  
Although there are reports of anaphylaxis to G-CSF use - this 
was considered unlikely.  
    She was placed on IV Zofran, lorazepam ___, and hydrated.  On 
the Day1 of hospitalization, her nausea/vomiting and diarrhea 
resolved.  There were no further episodes of fever.  Due to low 
suspicion for bacterial infection, no antibiotics were given.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

   It was a pleasure looking after you.  As you may know, you 
were admitted with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and 
vomiting.  You had multiple infection tests to evaluate for a 
possible cause for these symptoms and the workup here did not 
yield any positive tests (which is a good thing).  
   CT scan of the abdomen revealed mild inflammation of the 
intestinal tract - which can occur in setting of certain viral 
gastroenteritis.  You were observed for several days and were 
noted to have significant improvement in your symptoms: 
resolution of the diarrhea and nausea and vomiting.  You should 
continue to improve as this infection resolves.
   Due to this episode, as you know, your schedule for cell 
harvesting at ___ will be postponed.  
They will continue to contact you to determine the optimal 
follow up.
   Your medications remain otherwise unchanged (compared to 
prior to admission). 
   We wish you quick recovery and good health!

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with history of dementia, HTN, BPH, hospitalization at 
OSH on ___ for syncope presents with another episode of 
witnessed syncope.  Pt found to have orthostatic hypotension and 
UTI. 
.
# Syncope workup: The patient's syncope workup included an 
examination of cardiac, autonomic, and neurological causes.  
Given the patient's preceding diaphoresis, paleness, and lack of 
post-ictal confusion or tiredness after the event, it was 
thought that this was a syncopal episode and not a seizure.  
Neurology was consulted and did not think that the etiology of 
LOC for this individual was a seizure or other neurological 
process and did not think that EEG or MRI was necessary. 
Notably, the patient had a recent Non contrast head CT done at 
the OSH and this was normal with no evidence of hemmorhage, 
ischemic stroke, infection, or masses.  The patient's vitals 
signs were remarkable for orthostatic hypotension.  Initially, 
the pt's SBP dropped by 40 and the HR increased by greater than 
40 upon lying to standing.  After volume repletion, the pt's 
blood pressures remained stable upon lying to standing, but the 
heart rate still increased by 40.  At the rehab facility, it was 
noted that his SBP mostly ranged in the ___ and during the time 
of his syncope, his BP was 60/40.  Because a contributing factor 
to his syncope was likely hypotension, we discontinued the 
patient's tamsulosin and doxazosin after emailing the patient's 
PCP, ___.  We found that the patient also had a UTI 
___ his indwelling foley catheter, which likely led to poor oral 
and fluid intake, as well as frequent urination, thereby 
exacerbating the patient's hypotension.  However, given that the 
patient's syncope occurred while he was sitting, it is unlikely 
that orthostasis in and of itself caused the event.  The pt's 
daughter does not give any history of a preceding event to 
elicit a vasovagal response.  The patient was tested for carotid 
hypersensitivity via massage and this was also negative.  
Repeated TTE during his hospitalization was unremarkable.  The 
patient was on telemetry throughout his hospital course and this 
was only remarkable for multiple PACs as well as one episode 
where the patient became tachycardic to about 150 which lasted 
for approximately a minute.  Based on this rhythm strip, I was 
unable to discern what the origin of the supraventricular 
tachycardia was: sinus tachycardia vs AVNRT vs 2:1 Atrial 
flutter. It was likely SVT. However, this was the only notable 
episode of tachycardia seen on telemetry and as this occurred in 
the middle of the night, the patient was not assessed during 
that time.  At this point, we cannot rule out an SVT in the 
setting of poor volume status and hypotension leading to the 
patient's syncope. We have placed the patient on ___ 
monitor.  If the monitor is not revealing and the patient 
continues to have syncopal events, a workup with tilt table 
testing, followed by EP study seems reasonable. 
.
# UTI: The pt was found to have a UTI in the setting of a 
chronic indwelling foley.  The patient's foley was discontinued 
and the patient voided well despite his history of BPH.  The 
patient was treated with oral ciprofloxacin 500mg BID.  The 
urine culture returned growing Proteus, which was what was 
initially suspected based on UA the susceptibilities showed 
adequate coverage with cephalexin. Ciprofloxacin was stopped. By 
definition, because of the indwelling foley, the patient's UTI 
is classified as complicated and will require another 10 days of 
cephalexin treatment.
.

# Anemia: The patient is anemic with a hct of about 30 which is 
similar to where he was at the OSH 2 weeks ago.  The pt had a 
low serum iron at 16, but ferritin and TIBC were normal.  The pt 
will likely need stool guaiac as an outpatient to evaluate for 
any bleeding as well as consideration of ferrous sulfate and 
consideration of addtional workup as appropriate including 
possible colonoscopy.
.
# Rising Creatinine: The pt's creatinine rose from 1.1 on 
admission to 1.3.  His FeNa was <1%.  The patient was given IV 
fluids to treat the prerenal etiology.  The cr on afternoon of 
admission was 1.2
.
# Transitional Issues: Going to ___.  Following up 
with Dr. ___ on ___.  If the ___ 
monitor is not revealing and the patient continues to have 
syncopal events, a workup with tilt table testing, followed by 
EP study seems reasonable at Dr. ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted after an episode of loss of 
consciousness at your nursing home.  To determine the cause of 
this, we monitored your blood pressures lying and standing, 
monitored your heart rhythms, and looked at your heart with an 
echocardiogram (which was normal). You were dehydrated and 
improved with IV fluids. Because your pressures were very 
different when standing and lying down, we discontinued one of 
your blood pressure medications (this was confirmed with your 
PCP ___. 

We are also sending you to ___ with a heart monitor 
in case you have another event where you lose consciousness so 
that the doctors ___ if there were any odd heart rhythms 
which may have brought on the event. The results of the monitor 
will be sent to Dr. ___. When the monitoring is complete you 
can mail the instrument back to ___ via the packaging 
provided.

KEY IMAGING:
============
___ CXR: Hazy opacity of the central right apex could 
represent focal 
consolidation/pneumonia or soft tissue lesion, though it could 
merely be a 
manifestation external, overlying material.. Left central line 
terminating 
within the right atrium and endovascular graft material 
projecting over the 
right apex. 

___ CT Chest: Ectasia of ascending aorta measuring 3.9 x 
4.1cm. Punctuate bilateral pulmonary nodules likely 
postinflammatory.

___ Ct Abd and Pelvis w/o Contrast: 
No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Cholelithiasis
Atrophy bilateral kidneys and moderate left-sided 
hydrouteronephrosis with no obstructive lesion or calculus 
noted. Fluid and gas filled tract extending from bladder to the 
anterior abdominal wall, likely from recent placement of a 
suprapubic catheter.

___ CT Chest: OSH - Image only, official report not 
available
___ CT Head: OSH - Image only, per report no acute 
intracranial abnormality
 
Brief Hospital Course:
========
SUMMARY
========
___ yo M with hx of vascular dementia, h/o ESBL UTIs, T2DM, ESRD 
on HD TTS, found down in his facility, who was admitted for 
altered mental status/hypotension and concern for dislodged 
tunneled dialysis catheter, found to have E. coli UTI, was 
transferred to MICU for hypotension responsive to fluids, then 
transferred to the floor once his hypotension resolved. He did 
well on meropenem and completed a course on ___.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
#Sepsis/UTI/Suprapubic catheter
Patient was found to be hypotensive ___ E. coli UTI that was 
sensitive to Bactrim, Zosyn, Meropenem, Ertapenem, Amikacin. Had 
leukocytosis to 11.9 on admission that became normal on ___. 
CT Chest was negative for pneumonia, CT Abdomen negative for any 
other infectious source. We were unable to confirm when 
patient's last suprapubic catheter exchange was, so it was 
exchanged here on ___. He was started on IV meropenem on 
___ for a 7-day course (last ___. His BCx showed no 
growth to date on discharge. A midline was placed on ___ so 
patient could complete his antibiotic course at his facility; 
however, patient's daughter preferred that he completed his 
antibiotic course in the hospital. Patient completed his 7-day 
course of meropenem on ___, and his midline was pulled prior 
to discharge. 

#Encephalopathy/Vascular dementia
Thought likely ___ sepsis iso vascular dementia. Non-con CT Head 
negative for acute intracranial process. Electrolytes were WNL, 
and patient had not started any new medications recently. He was 
at baseline per his daughter prior to discharge.

#ESRD on HD TTS/Dislodged tunneled dialysis catheter
There was a question of whether patient's catheter became 
dislodged. ___ evaluated the catheter on ___, reported not 
dislodged, added sutures with no concern for contamination, and 
stated that it was working properly. Patient continued on his 
regular HD schedule. 

#Normocytic normochromic anemia
Patient received 1 unit of pRBCs n ___ for Hgb of 5.8. Thought 
likely anemia of chronic disease ___ ESRD. There was no evidence 
of acute blood loss and CT Abdomen was negative for bleed. He 
had a normal total bilirubin so hemolysis thought to be 
unlikely. There were no schistocytes on his smear. Iron studies 
were done, but they were thought to be unreliable as they were 
done after patient received a unit of blood. His absolute 
reticulocyte count was 0.07, so he had inappropriate response to 
anemia. He continued to receive Epogen with HD. His Hgb 
uptrended and remained in 7's upon discharge.

#Thrombocytopenia
Patient's platelets intermittently dropped, thought likely ___ 
ESRD. Upon discharge they were WNL.

#Constipation
Patient given bowel regimen. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
His Humalog ISS was continued.

#Asthma
His albuterol nebs PRN were continued.

#Glaucoma
His latanoprost and bimatoprost were continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================

for hospice care; unclear if daughter fully understands what 
hospice care means, especially since patient is still full code.
[] Suprapubic catheter - Catheter was exchanged by urology on 
___.
[] Please repeat CBC on ___. Discharge Hgb: 8.1

IMAGING:
___ CT AP without contrast
IMPRESSION:  
1. Fat stranding, fascial thickening and prominent lymph nodes 
in the right
lower quadrant may be due to a terminal ileitis and/or cecitis; 
however,
assessment of the bowel is limited without IV or oral contrast. 
The presence
of intramural fat within the terminal ileum and cecum also 
suggests underlying
chronic inflammation of these regions.  No free fluid or free 
air.  
 
2. Chronic findings include hepatic steatosis, atherosclerois 
and fibroid
uterus.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with DM, HLD, HTN, and history of multiple psychiatric 
issues currently not prescribed any medications who presents 
with abdominal pain associated with peritoneal signs on exam 
without fever or leukocytosis and improved with bowel movements, 
several diarrhea bowel movements per day and CT findings 
consistent with ileitis/cecitis.

# Gastroenteritis
Differential initially broad and included viral and bacterial 
gastroenteritis, appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease and 
irritable bowel syndrome. She was initially started on admission 
on flagyl, but this was held given lack of fever, leukocytosis 
or bloody diarrhea. Normal colonoscopy in ___ argued 
against IBD and colonic malignancy, and acute appendicitis was 
also felt unlikely given lack of fever or leukocytosis. CRP 
noted to be 179.3, concerning for severe infection, 
rheumatologic disease or infection. Clinical picture of 
abdominal pain improved with bowel movement could be suggestive 
of IBS. CT imaging only revealed terminal ileitis/cecitis, with 
possible chronic inflammation in that area. After IVF and pain 
management with 2.5-5 mg oral oxycodone, Ms. ___ abdominal 
pain, diarrhea and abdominal exam improved rapidly over the 
course of two days. Her CRP downtrended to 77 in two days. Given 
her overall improvement, and stable vital signs and labs 
throughout her inpatient stay, she was discharged to home with 
instructions to call her PCP for close ___ as an 
outpatient or if her symptoms became worse.

# Hypotension
Resolved upon admission, IV fluids were administered over the 
course of her inpatient stay.

# ___
Labs consistent with pre-renal etiology in the setting of poor 
PO intake over past few days. Cr improved with IVF and was back 
to her baseline at the time of discharge. She was tolerating 
adequate fluid intake at the time of discharge and was 
instructed to continue this.

# anion gap metabolic acidosis
Noted on chemistry panel upon admission, etiology not entirely 
clear given negative urine ketones and normal serum lactate, 
lack of uremia, no serum osmolar gap and no history of 
salicylate use. Gap presumed to be from undetected ketones in 
the setting of recent poor PO intake. Anion gap improved with 
fluid resuscitation.

# Macrocytic anemia
This is a chronic issue that was stable during her inpatient 
stay. 

# Hypertension
Lisinopril held in setting ___ and reports of hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Psychiatric-Patient was admitted to the unit without 
incident. He initially presented with more insight into his 
disordered thinking. He felt that it was likely due to the 
recreational drugs he was using. Midway through his hospital 
course, he experienced a panic attack; worrying about having a 
similar attack along with his elevated bed increased his overall 
anxiety level, and led to significant difficulty sleeping. At 
this time he began to exhibit symptoms concerning for mania 
including agitation, pressured speech, grandiose statements, and 
increased paranoid ideation. The patient reported that the staff 
were conspiring to ""test him"" with a variety of methods: 8 hour 
changes in nursing shifts, delays/confusion in medication 
delivery, and interruptions during interviews.  He frequently 
became very agitated during interviews, which often preceded 
paranoid accusations; similarly, he became agitated during a 
phone conversation with his mother and later during a family 
meeting, accusing his mother of siding with the hospital staff 
to keep him in the hospital indefinitely.  

Above written by Dr. ___ M.D.; remainder of 
hospital course below written by ___ M.D.
.
On ___ he became acutely anxious about not being discharged 
from the hospital, and made some superficial stab injuries to 
his neck with the use of a pen; which did not require any suture 
repair.  

Psychopharmacology-Risperdal was initiated and titrated up to 6 
mg PO qHS without side effects in order to target his sx's of 
psychosis. Patient was educated on risk and benefits including 
weight gain and a fasting lipid panel was check for a baseline. 
Patient reported increasingly organized thoughts and the ability 
to reality test regarding his ideas of reference. He denied any 
further thoughts of suicidality.  Based on potential mood 
symptoms, the team discussed with the patient the possibility of 
adding a mood stabilizer to his treatment; and eventually agreed 
to being started on lithium; and was titrated up to 600mg PO 
bid; and was found to have a level of 1.2 on ___.  With the 
therapeutic level of lithium, the mood related sx's above along 
with his pressured speech, grandiosity, irritability, and 
agitation resolved.  Upon discharge, his ibuprofen was 
discontinued as well, given his prn vicodin was managing his 
pain, and to avoid potential interactions between ibuprofen and 
lithium.  Mr. ___ was agreeable to outpatient psychiatric 
followup; continuation of these meds, and also to the idea of 
transitioning to a partial hospital program. 

Behavioral/Mileu-Patient was cooperative and in good behavioral 
control on the unit. He attended groups and was motivated.

2. Medical- Patient was followed by orthopedic surgery service. 
Physical therapy was consulted. He received Vicodin PRN with 
good pain control, which was successfully tapered. His left 
humerus was re X-rayed and orthopedics followed up the result, 
which showed improved alignment of the fragments, but needed 
another film in a few weeks to observe if further healing 
occurs. He should follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient 
in 2 weeks.  He should continue to utilize his sling/brace as 
instructed until then, and continue to sleep upright in bed, and 
be non-weight bearing for his left arm.

3. Legal- Patient was admitted to Deac 4 on a ___ from 
the ED; and he signed in on a conditional voluntary basis upon 
arrival. 

4. Dispo-Patient was discharged to his mother's home; with 
aftercare at ___, and outpatient psychiatric providers.

.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  ___:
Acute cardiogenic failure characterized by interstitial edema, 
cardiomegaly, and pleural effusion.
.
ECG ___:
Sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate. Consider left 
atrial abnormality. Q waves in leads II, III and aVF. Consider 
inferior myocardial infarction of undetermined age. R wave 
reversal in leads V2-V3 with Q waves through lead V6 with ST 
segment elevation. Consider acute anterior myocardial 
infarction. No previous tracing available for comparison. 
Clinical correlation is suggested. 
.
TTE ___:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with 
akinesis of the distal half of the ventricle with an apical 
aneurysm. The basal segments are hypokinetic (LVEF <20 %). Left 
ventricular cardiac index is severely depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). 
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, but the 
apex is heavily trabeculated. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the mid free wall. The 
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets appear structurally 
normal. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is a small pericardial effusion most prominent around the 
right atrium without evidence of diastolic collapse/tamponade 
physiology.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular cavity enlargement with 
regional and global systolic dysfunction c/w diffuse process 
(multivessel CAD most likely, but cannot exclude toxin, 
metabolic, etc.). Mild moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated 
ascending aorta and arch.
If clinically indicated, a cardiac MR may be more sensitive for 
detection of a left ventricular thrombus. 
.
Cardiac Catheterization ___: Prelim:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system 
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had 
diffuse 
___ stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified with diffuse mild 

plaquing proximally, severe disease after S1 with total 
occlusion. The 
disetal vessel was not visualized. The S1 had 50% stenosis at 
its 
origin. The LCX was heavily calcified with mid 85% stenosis 
after modest 
OM1. The OM2 and OM3 were small. The upper pole of OM1 was 
occluded and 
filled retrograde by left to left collaterals. The OM3 had 
subtotal 
occlusion proximally. The distal AV groove CX had 90% stenosis 
before 
LPDA and collaterals to distal RCA. The RCA was moderately 
calcified 
with mid ___ stenosis. There was diffuse plaquing in the distal 
AV 
groove RCA supplying the RPLs with faint filling of very disstal 
AVG 
groove RCA. 
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling 
pressures were within normal range (mean RA pressure was 6mmHg 
and RVEDP 
was 9mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were elevated 
measuring 
42/23mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean 
PCW 
pressure was 25mmHg and LVEDP was 28mmHg). The systemic arterial 

pressures were within normal range measuring 105/75mmHg. There 
was no 
significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of 
the 
catheter from the left ventricle into the ascending aorta. The 
cardiac 
index calculated using an assumed oxygen consumption rate was 
normal at 
2.4 l/min/m2.   
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Elevated left sided filling pressures. 
3. Normal cardiac index. 
.
CTA CORONARY ARTERIES W/QUANTITATIVE CALCIUM  ___: Prelim:
CTA CORONARY ARTERIES W/QUANTI; CT HEART W&W/O CONTRAST;GATING
1. Moderate bibasal effusions with atelectasis at the lung 
bases.
2. Extensive coronary atherosclerosis.
Please note further details of the CT coronary angiography will 
be added as an addendum once reconstructions have been performed 
in the 3D imaging lab.
.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with uncontrolled hypertension has 
experienced dyspnea on exertion for one week.
.
# Coronary artery disease:  EKG suggests ischemic cardiomyopathy 
with aneurysm.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.  Patient's 
presentation is consistent with old ischemic episodes.  Cardiac 
catheterization showed three vessel disease.  Appreciated 
cardiac surgery evaluation for possible CABG.  Given his 
comorbidities and no benefit to be gained from LAD bypass, CABG 
was not recommended.  Patient was treated medically with full 
dose Aspirin, Lipitor 80 mg daily, carvedilol and lisinopril.  
Echocardiogram showed EF < 20% with hypokinesis and aneurysmal 
apex.  Patient was started on heparin drip.  Patient was 
discharged on lovenox bridge to coumadin.  Stress MIBI results 
reviewed with cardiologists suggest that there may be some 
viability in lateral and inferior walls.  Patient was 
recommended Percutaneous coronary intervention.  Patient wanted 
to go home and decide later.  
.
# Pump: Admitted with acute systolic heart failure.  Most likely 
due to multivessel coronary artery disease and/or severe 
uncontrolled hypertension.  Patient was diureses with lasix and 
spiranolactone.  Patient responded to this treatement.  He was 
also started on carvedilol and lisinopril as above.  Patient 
will follow up with ___ as out patient.  He will need 
a repeat echocardiogram in 4 to 5 weeks to reassess for possible 
ICD placment for primary prevention.  Patient will decide 
whether to get PCI and notify ___.  Anticoagulation as 
above.  His functional status improved prior to discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with 
heart failure.  Your heart failure is most likely due to 
previous heart attacks.  You recieved diuretics to improve heart 
failure.  You had a procedure called cardiac catheterization 
which showed multiple obstruction in the arteries supplying 
blood to your heart.  Cardiac surgeons evaluated you but advised 
against bypass surgery as risks outweighed benefits.  You may 
benefit from coronary angioplasty with stents but you wanted to 
go home and come back later to get the procedure done.  
.
Please take all of the medications as written.  You are started 
on full dose aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol and lisinopril.  
You were also started on lasix (furosemide) and aldactone to 
take extra fluid off of your body.  You were started on blood 
thinner called lovenox as you are at risk for developing blood 
clots due to poor heart structure/function.
.
Please check your weight every day first thing in the morning 
after urinating.  Please call Dr. ___ if weight is 
increasing by greater than 3 pounds.  Weight on discharge 78.6kg 
or 173 pounds.
.
Please keep all of the follow up appointments.  You need a 
repeat Echocardiogram in four weeks to assess your heart 
function.  If your heart function is still depressed, you may 
need an ICD.  Please discuss this with your cardiologist.
.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or any other 
concerning sympotms, please call your primary care doctor or

Discharge Condition:
afebrile, hypertensive to 170/78, clinically stable, K 5.1, Cr 3
 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with hyperkalemia without any 
associated EKG changes. You were treated with an extra dose of 
kayexelate and IV fluids. You potassium has improved.  It is 
important to remember that given your chronic renal failure, we 
can tolerate a slightly higher potassium than we would in 
someone without renal failure.  You should continue to follow up 
with your nephrologist and your primary care doctor regularly. 
It is important that you keep yourself well hydrated especially 
because the kayexelate that you take to keep your potassium down 
gives you diarrhea and makes you lose water.  As we have noted 
that you were persistently hypertensive during your admission we 
increased the dose of your clonidine patch. You should continue 
to titrate your anti-hypertensives as per your primary care 
physician.  You also were noted to have an asymptomatic UTI for 
which you were treated with Cefpodoxime. You will complete an 
additional two day course for this at rehab. You also underwent 
a CT of your spine to evaluate your incontinence which 
demonstrated severe degenerative disc disease but no evidence of 
cord compression or tumor. 
.
You should return to the hospital if you experience potassium 
greater than 6 with EKG changes, otherwise you can likely be 
managed by contacting your nephrologist. You should return to 
the ER if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, 
chest pain, high fevers or uncontrolled nausea and vomiting.
.
It has been a pleasure taking care of you at ___

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ y/o F with a history of CAD s/p CABG ___, PVD s/p stenting 
___, IDDM, HTN, HLD, hep C, hypothyroidism, and chronic 
bronchitis who presented to ___ ED complaining of ___ R knee 
pain s/p fall 2wks PTA, ~50lb weight gain over the past 6 weeks 
as she has noted swelling in her ankles and feet, along with 
worsening orthopnea, and painful skin ulcers ___ sunburn also 
2wks ago. 
.
Knee pain is due to a fall Ms. ___ took when trying to step up 
and onto a curb--she explained that she missed her step, fell, 
and spent 30 minutes lying on the ground waiting for someone to 
come help her. This fall was her third in the last few months, 
having previously fallen on her face while walking outside her 
apartment ~6 weeks ago, along with a fall ~4 weeks ago when she 
was trying to swing a bag of garbage into the dumpster, during 
which she landed on her L arm and skinned her elbow. Ms. ___ 
denies syncope, palpitations, and confusion leading up to these 
falls, explaining instead that she has felt some general loss of 
balance over the past several months, most apparent when walking 
(i.e. balance issues not present without exertion).
.
Following the fall in which she injured her knee, Ms. ___ 
presented to her PCP with pain and erythema over her right 
pretibia, which was suspicious for cellulitis. Ms. ___ was 
started on Cephalexin 500mg PO TID, but her erythema and 
tenderness ahve not decreased with this treatment.
.
As far as the rash on her legs, Ms. ___ related that several 
weeks ago she was sitting outside for several hours in the yard 
of her apartment complex, wearing shorts, when she developed a 
bad sunburn on her anterior distal thighs, just proximal to her 
knees. This was unusual for her--she doesn't usually burn and 
appears to have type 4 or 5 skin, but on this occasion she 
developed a burn that, over the course of ___ days, developed 
into large blisters on either leg, which popped shortly after 
they appeared. Since then, she has had persistent erosions, the 
remnants of her bullae, which are tender, but have not wept any 
fluid.
.
Finally, in terms of her swelling, dyspnea, orthopnea and cough, 
Ms. ___ explained that for the past ~six weeks, she has gained 
approximately 10lbs each week and noted a concomitant increase 
in DOE, along with a cough which has been productive of some 
sputum but no blood. She visited her PCP on ___ with 
complaints of DOE and cough, as well as bilateral lower 
extremity swelling. According to her PCP's note, Ms. ___ had 
previously been treated with furosemide 20mg BID which she had 
self-terminated, and her PCP advised her to resume taking 
Furosemide 20mg BID, which she has done with approximately 50% 
adherence. Ms. ___ was also prescribed prednisone 10mg daily, 
which Ms. ___ says she took faithfully, but has recently 
finished (she can't remember when she took her last dose).
.
On presentation to the ED today VS were 97.5 142/98 68 20 
100%RA, with a fingerstick glucose of 236. Her chief complaint 
on presentation was ___ knee pain with fluid drainage, in 
addition to the above dyspnea/swelling and ulcers from sunburn. 
Workup in the ED for her dyspnea included PA and Lateral CXR, 
which showed bilateral pleural effusions and a left basilar 
opacity, which has increased since her previous CXR on ___. Leg 
erythema/pain was treated as presumed cellulitis with 1g IV 
vancomycin, and a Knee xray showed no fracture, dislocation or 
effusion.
.
Since coming up to the floor Ms. ___ has continued to complain 
of ___ pain, although she has not appeared to be in such pain. 
She has been fatigued, which she ascribes to lots of activity 
coming here and in the ED.

IMAGING
___ Renal US:
IMPRESSION: Mild increase in renal echogenicity bilaterally 
consistent with chronic renal disease. No hydronephrosis. Small 
bilateral pleural effusion and scant trace of ascites in the 
abdomen. 

___ ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
there is very mild global hypokinesis on the current study. The 
degree of aortic regurgittaion has incresed slightly. Estimated 
pulmonary pressures were lower on the current study.  

___ Knees 2 views:
IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On presentation to the ED VS 97.5 142/98 68 20 100%RA, with FSBS 
236. Her chief complaint on presentation was ___ knee pain 
with erythema and fluid drainage, in addition to 
dyspnea/swelling and ulcers from sunburn. Workup in the ED for 
her dyspnea included PA and Lateral CXR, which showed bilateral 
pleural effusions and a left basilar opacity, which has 
increased since her previous CXR on ___. Leg erythema/pain was 
treated as presumed cellulitis with 1g IV vancomycin, and a Knee 
xray showed no fracture, dislocation or effusion.
.
On the floor Ms. ___ continued to complain of ___ pain 
during her first day, in addition to fatigue. Initial treatment 
for her cellulitis was vancomycin 1g Q24H and cefepime 2g IV 
q24h. This was switched to PO clindamycin Q6H 300mg Q6H on ___ 
evening, following a discussion with PCP ___, and in 
accordance to a feeling that the infection was superficial and 
less likely to be pseudamonas.
.
Workup of edema started from ddx of CHF (favored by edema, risk 
factors including HTN, HLD, CAD, BNP 5780, disfavored by lack of 
JVD and pulmonary edema) / liver disease (favored by chronic Hep 
C, chronic hypoalbuminemia) and nephrotic syndrome (favored by 
hypoalbuminemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and chronic hepC). Spot 
urine protein:Cr 15.8 on ___ suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. 
Will continue diuresis and salt restrict (already on heart 
healthy diet).  Pt had high protein creatinine ratio and 
hypoalbuminemic.  Pt slowly improved and biopsy was not done 
while pt was inpatient.  She slowly improved and her symptoms 
resolved.  Renal was considering a renal biopsy, but felt that 
her symptoms were likely related to diabetic nephropathy.  In 
the course of this discussion, the patient refused to stay in 
the hospital and demanded to leave.  We scheduled outpatient 
follow up with Dr. ___ in order to further work up possible 
liver disease in lieu of her hepatitis C.  
.
Diabetes - Pt was admitted to the floor hyperglycemic with a ___ 
of 321.  She was started on an insulin sliding scale, but her 
sugars were difficult to control.  We adjusted her sliding scale 
as necessary and at time of discharge her finger sticks were 
within an acceptable range.  Pt gabapentin was also continued 
for her diabetic neuropathy.
.  
Asthma - patient was currently asymptomatic.  Continued daily 
advair therapy 500 mcg-50 mcg/Dose 1 puff twice a day and will 
order Albuterol nebulizer treatment PRN for exacerbation.  Pt 
did not have asthmatic symptoms throughout the course of her 
hospital stay.
.   
Bronchitis - Patient is currently asymptomatic. Will not give 
Prednisone in the hospital as patient bronchitis seems to have 
resolved. Will discuss with patient the last dose and taper 
accordingly.  
.
Depression - Asymptomatic at this time.  Pt was not expressing 
any signs of depression.  Continued Bupropion and Escitalopram 
during the course of her hospital stay.
.  
Hypothyroidism - Pt was asymptomatic throughout the course of 
her hospital stay and was continued on levothyroxine.
.
Pt was demanding to leave the hospital at the time of discharge. 
 We recommended that she stayed in the hospital, but she was 
refusing and we felt that at this point in her medical treatment 
she was stable for discharge with further work up in the 
outpatient setting.

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ ___ male with a PMHx of HTN, HL, 
obesity,
multiple acute small bilateral ischemic strokes (___), 
and
possible OSA (no formal diagnosis) who presents with four
episodes of unresponsiveness. 

He was in his USOH when he woke up this morning (___). His
family drove him to ___ for his son's wedding at 3pm. He
made it through the ceremony without incident. 
While sitting down at the reception at 8pm, his family noticed
this his eyes rolled in a circle and then deviated off to one
side (but family not sure which side). He was also leaning to 
one
side (but didn't fall, family not sure which side). He had LOC
and was unresponsive to questions, but his eyes remained open. 
He
also had diaphoresis, drooling, and pursed lips. His ""whole body
tensed"" during this event, which his son identified when he put
his arms on his dad's shoulders and noticed that they were 
tense.
This entire event lasted 2 minutes, and the patient was
subsequently back at baseline. The patient only recalls the
vomiting; he does not recall the other symptoms above. 

A second event occurred that was just the like the first and
again lasted 2 minutes or so. Subsequently, the patient became
dysarthric, had N/V, and his lids drooped as though he was 
sleepy
(but his lids would open up if called). There was no confusion
after the event, per his son, and the patient knew who he was,
where he was, and what the date was (family asked him these
questions). A third similar event with vomiting afterward
occurred in the car on the way to ___ around 9pm. A fourth
similar event occurred in the ___ ED. At the time of 
interview,
the son felt that his father was still dysarthric but otherwise
back to baseline. The patient still reports a little nausea but
otherwise denies new symptoms or deficits including dysarthria.

He had a similar episode 2 months ago while standing and talking

___ CTA HEAD AND NECK
1. Compared to ___, there is a new infarct involving the 
right inferior parietal, lateral temporal, and superolateral 
occipital lobe.  This infarct has a substantial chronic 
component, with interim enlargement of the atrium of the right 
lateral ventricle indicating parenchymal volume loss. 
2. Multiple small chronic infarcts in the supratentorial white 
matter, basal ganglia, and right thalamus. 
3. No evidence for flow-limiting arterial stenosis in the neck. 
4. Unchanged 2 short-segment foci of narrowing of the distal V4 
segment of the right vertebral artery. 
5. High-grade stenosis of the proximal P1 segment of the left 
posterior 
cerebral artery has progressed since ___. 
6. Hypoplasia versus occlusion of the P1 segment of the right 
posterior 
cerebral artery.  Small patent right posterior communicating 
artery.  Chronic occlusion of the P2 segment of the right 
posterior cerebral artery.  These findings are unchanged since 
___. 
7. Postsurgical changes and chronic inflammation in the 
paranasal sinuses. 
8. Multiple periapical lucencies in the left maxilla.  Please 
correlate 
clinically whether active dental inflammation may be present. 
When 3D reformatted images of finalized by the imaging lab, an 
addendum to 
this report will be issued. 

___ MRI HEAD
Compared to ___, there is a new infarction involving the 
inferior right parietal, lateral right temporal, and 
superior/lateral right occipital lobes.  Portions of the right 
temporal and occipital infarction appear late subacute to 
chronic, with associated new ex vacuo enlargement of the 
occipital and temporal horns of the right lateral ventricle.  
Other portions of the infarction appear early subacute.  No mass 
effect. 
Expected evolution of the multiple small white matter and 
cortical infarcts in the right cerebral hemisphere and left 
centrum semiovale compared to ___. Additional more 
chronic chronic basal ganglia and white matter infarcts, as well 
as presumed sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in 
the supratentorial white matter, are also again seen. 

___ TTE
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is 
an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat 
pad. 
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.  

___ CT-TORSO
1. Findings are concerning for gastric carcinoma with 
___ lymph node metastases and omental metastasis. 
2. No evidence of malignant disease in the thorax.  Mild 
enlargement of the left thigh thyroid lobe could be further 
clarified by ultrasound.  The upper abdomen is described in 
detail in the abdominal part of the CT report. 

___ cytology
DIAGNOSIS:
 TOUCH PREP OF CORE, INTRA ABDOMINAL LYMPH NODE: POSITIVE FOR 
MALIGNANT CELLS.
 Consistent with undifferentiated malignant tumor.
 See concurrent core biopsy ___ for further 
characterization 

___ interventional radiology
FINDINGS:
 1. Successful CT-guided biopsy of an omental nodule. Pathology 
pending.
 IMPRESSION:
 Successful CT-guided of an omental nodule. Pathology pending.
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ RH male with a PMHx of HTN, HL, 
obesity, multiple acute small bilateral ischemic strokes (___), and possible OSA (no formal diagnosis) who presents with 
four episodes of unresponsiveness c/f seizures.

**NEUROLOGY FLOOR COURSE**
#UNRESPONSIVENESS
The four spells were thought to be most probably complex partial 
seizures with secondary generalization and were likely triggered 
by either the recent stroke or the ___ stroke. Head 
imaging showed a new infarct involving the right inferior 
parietal, lateral temporal, and superolateral occipital lobe 
which appeared to be superimposed on chronic infarcts. 
Continuous EEG did not disclose evidence of ongoing seizures or 
identifiable foci, although given the high suspicion for 
seizures, we started levetiracetam which was titrated to 1000mg 
twice daily. He did not have any further events while on the 
floor. No definitive cause of the possible seizures were 
identified; likely, the infarcts may have had triggered them. 
Moreover, given the recurrence of embolic strokes, we were 
concerned about hypercoagulability and occult malignancy, 
especially given the marked weight loss and new-onset microcytic 
anemia present on admission. A TTE was unremarkable. D-dimer was 
elevated concerning for underlying inflammatory state. Patient 
was also not up to date on cancer screening. Therefore, we 
obtained a CT-torso which revealed thickening of the stomach and 
suspicious lymph nodes in the abdomen concerning for gastric 
malignancy.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to be involved with your care at ___ 
___.

You were admitted to the hospital after you experienced several 
episodes of seizures during an important family event.  You 
received a neurologic evaluation for these seizures which 
included a workup for stroke.  There was evidence of a new 
stroke that was thought to be secondary to another medical 
cause. You received a workup for conditions that can cause clots 
that included imaging of your abdomen, which demonstrated 
findings concerning for cancer of the stomach.  There was 
evidence of thickening of your stomach as well as suspicious 
lymph nodes as well as an omental nodule that was biopsied.  The 
results of this biopsy are pending at the time of discharge, but 
you will most likely will have follow-up in outpatient ___ 
clinic to best determine the course of care from here on.

When you go home it will be very important for you to continue 
your previous medications for blood pressure.  We have also 
started you on a medication to thin your blood and reduce the 
chance that you may have a repeat stroke.  This medication he 
will take twice a day by injection.  It is called Lovenox.  You 
also should continue on the antiseizure medication called 
Keppra.  You should continue both of these new medications until 
you see your new Dr. ___ in ___ to follow-up on the 
stroke.  We also recommend that you see your primary care doctor 
within ___ few weeks of discharge from the hospitalization.

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ ___ Team

Chief Complaint:
L flank and subcostal pain, mediastinal mass on MRI
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F presents with L subcostal and flank pain, 
epidural lesions on OSH MRI and a mediastinal mass on CTA. Pt 
first experienced flank pain on ___ three days prior to 
admission. The pain increased in intensity over the following 
day into the night. The pain was left subcostal and flank pain 
that did not radiate at the level of T9 with accompanying left 
flank pain that was ___ in severity made worse with deep 
inhalation. She does not have a history of trauma or strain. She 
had no chest pain or shortness of breath with this pain. She 
endorses having some nausea and reduced appetite, but no 
vomiting or diarrhea. She has had chills and sweats but 
associates this with menopausal symptoms. She has been afebrile. 
Because of her pain, she visited her PCP who prescribed her 
vicodin to little relief. Her PCP referred the patient to an OSH 
ED for further evaluation. At OSH, an CT abdomen and pelvis w/o 
contrast was obtained which was obtained with question of a 
spinal lesion and a mediastinal mass. A follow-up MRI of the 
spine at the hospital was read as having an inflammatory lesion 
at the level of the lower thoracic spine, with a question of 
possible infection. She received toradol, dilaudid, zofran and 
ciprofloxacin at OSH before transfer to BI ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 98.8, HR 108, BP 140/89, RR 16, 
SaO2 95% RA. Nuerosurgery was consulted. A wet read of the OSH 
MRI by neurosurg suggested posterior epidural lesions that were 
posited to be hematomas vs artifact from a poor study. A CTA 
performed in the ED has a wet read that shows an anterior 
mediastinal mass that is likely residual thymic tissue. Labs in 
the ED were significant for an Hct of 32.3, a U/A wnl and normal 
chem 7. Patient then came to the floor.  
.  
On the floor, pt was experiencing ___ flank pain. Otherwise, 
she had a mild headache and no evolution of symptoms. 
.  
Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI; also recent weight gain, 2 day h/o constipation
(-) Denies fever. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea 
or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest 
pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied vomiting, diarrhea, or 
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No 
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

MRI T spine 
Final Report
INDICATION: ___ woman with left flank/subcostal pain, 
mild dyspnea,
concern for possible mass or discitis per outside hospital 
report.
 
COMPARISON: Outside hospital MR from ___.
 
TECHNIQUE: MR images were obtained through the thoracic spine 
using sagittal
T1, T2, STIR and sagittal T1 post-contrast images. Axial T1- and 
T2-weighted
images were obtained and reviewed.
 
FINDINGS:
 
There is preservation of normal thoracic kyphosis with normal 
vertebral body
height and signal morphology. The intervertebral disc spaces are 
preserved
with normal signal intensity and morphology. The spinal cord is 
normal in
signal intensity and morphology. No epidural, prevertebral or 
paravertebral
abnormalities are noted. There are small left greater than right 
simple
pleural effusions. Partially imaged abdomen is unremarkable. The 
partially
imaged aorta is unremarkable as well.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Normal thoracic spine MRI, except for some anterior 
osteophytes. No
epidural abscess, discitis or osteomyelitis.
 
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F, otherwise healthy, presenting with L 
subcostal and flank pain and a question of epidural spine 
lesions on CT from OSH.
.  
#  Epidural lesions: From the outside hospital, there was a 
concern for a posterior mediastinal mass along the level of 
T8-T12 with a question of inflammation and possible disk 
herniation.  Due to poor quality of OSH MRI, MR was repeated at 
___.  Repeat MRI in house was normal without did not show any 
spinal or paraspinal pathologies.
.  
#  Left subcostal and flank pain: Pt came in with ___ sharp, 
constant flank pain made worse with deep inhalation that does 
not radiate. After the epidural pathologies were ruled out, we 
reviewed OSH records and ED workup to rule out other etiologies 
of flank pain. Workup was unimpressive for nephrolithiasis (no 
hydronephrosis or L renal stones on CT abdomen) and 
pylonephritis (bland U/A, afebrile). Read of the OSH pelvic U/S 
given at transfer show evidence of uterine myomas that do not 
appear changed, but no cystic adnexal process and indicated in 
the CT abdomen and pelvis. Given the history and physical, pain 
is likely due to muskuloskeletal strain vs shingles with lesions 
that are not yet manifest. She was treated supportively with 
pain control and will follow up with her PCP for ongoing care. 
.
# Constipation: Pt has been constipated for last two days with 
some discomfort and bowel distention. She was given milk of 
magnesia, colace and senna PRN. She did not have a bowel 
movement in house.
.
#Transitions of care: Pt still has L flank pain upon discharge.
- L flank pain: Pt is being prescribed percocet ___ tabs Q4H:PRN 
for pain. She should follow up with her PCP to have ___ further 
workup of the flank pain. Of note: OSH pelvic U/S revealed 
uterine myomas that do not appear changed, but no cystic adnexal 
process.
- Constipation: Patient should take a bowel regimen at home to 
relieve her constipation and follow up with her PCP.
 
Medications on Admission:
Flexeril 10mg BID
 
Discharge Medications:
1. oxycodone-acetaminophen ___ mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO 
every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 5 days: Please take 
this for breakthrough pain between Ibuprofen doses.

left flank pain

Secondary:
Constipation

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital because you had pain on your left back 
and under your ribs, and also because you had some scans from 
your outside hospital that were concerning. We had our 
nuerosurgeons see you and review your MRI and they thought the 
MRI scan looked abnormal because of motion during the study. 
Your repeat MRI came back normal. You also got a CT scan while 
in the ED to make sure you didn't have any clots in your lungs, 
called a pulmonary embolism. That CT came back normal. You also 
got some blood and urine tests, all of which were reassuring. 
While you were here, we gave you pain medication for your back 
pain which seemed to help. We do not think that your back pain 
is caused by kidney stones, infection or any masses. You are 
able to go home with some pain medication. 

While you are taking Percocet for your back pain you should 
avoid driving and making important decisions because Percocet 
can make you drowsy. Percocet can make you very constipated, so 
you should take docusate and senna to avoid constipation. These 
can be bought in any drug store. Please be sure to also drink 
plenty of fluids. You can also try drinking prune juice. If you 
are still constipated after this, you should try stronger 
laxatives, like lactulose and then dulcolax. Also, try to use 
your percocet less to see if this helps you get a bowel 
movement.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding which stopped 
without treatment. You were seen by the gastroenterologists who 
recommended you have an outpatient colonoscopy to search for a 
cause for your bleeding. You were also found to have worsening 
of your kidney function. This improved with intravenous fluids.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of dCHF, DM, ventral hernia repair and 
recurrent skin/soft tissue infections who presents for dislodged 
foley, found to have ___.

___
Patient with admission Cr of 1.7 with normal baseline Cr of 1.0. 
___ likely secondary to glucosuria from uncontrolled DM causing 
osmotic diuresis. He was given 2L IVF with improvement of his 
renal function to baseline. Lisinopril held in setting ___ 
and hypotension. He was discharged on reduced dose of 10mg 
lisinopril.

#Hypotension
Patient hypotensive to low ___ at on ___, but 
asymptomatic. Likely hypovolemia as he responded to fluid bolus 
and was normotensive. He was discharged on reduced dose of 10mg 
lisinopril and amlodipine was held.

#Ventral hernia repair
#Soft tissue infection: 
Per ID note ___, he is on indefinite course of Augmentin to 
suppress bugs for SSI. Exam with putative prurulence of deep 
tissue which was concerning for potential infection vs poor 
wound care. He had had MDR organisms grown from his wound in the 
past. Concern for sepsis, as he was hypotensive temporarily, and 
he was broadened temporarily to daptomycin/cefepime 
(___) and transitioned back to PO augmentin when there 
was no sign of active infection. Surgery saw patient and 
reassured that wound is better than previously. Wound team saw 
patient and gave additional wound care recs. Discharged with ___ 
services. 

#Chronic diastolic CHF: 
Difficult to assess volume status given his obesity. He was 
hypovolemic initially as evidenced by hypotension and ___ which 
improved with fluids while holding diuretics. He diuresed 
significantly without diuretic likely ___ glucosuria at home. 
Home dose of torsemide 60mg BID. After fluid resuscitation 
initially, he was trialed on torsemide 40mg with stable weight. 
Discharge weight: 176 kg. 

#DM, hyperglycemia: 
Patient only using lantus BID with sliding scale insulin. He has 
poorly controlled DM and would benefit from standing Humalog as 
what he was instructed to do on his last discharge. ___ 
consulted titrated his insulin. On discharge on lantus 72u BID, 
and Humalog ___ with meals.

#Constipation: 
In setting of opioid use. He was given aggressive bowel regimen: 
lactulose, miralax, bisacodyl, senna with improvement.

#Pyuria
UA on ___ initially concerning for infection although Ucx 
without growth. He was again advised that his elective 
indwelling foley catheter put him at risk for infection, sepsis, 
multidrug resistance and possibly death. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

#COPD: Continued home albuterol, advair

#Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin

#Anxiety, depression: Continued home BusPIRone, Citalopram 

#GERD: Continued home omeprazole

#Chronic generalized pain: Continued home methadone, oxycodone, 
gabapentin. Per recent MassPMP: on gabapentin 600mg TID

For billing purposes only: >30 minutes spent on patient care and 
coordination on day of discharge.

Liver Ultrasound:

FINDINGS: The liver shows mildly increased echogenicity 
consistent with fatty
infiltration, but no focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation. The
portal vein is patent with directionally appropriate flow. 
Within the neck of
the gallbladder is a 2 cm shadowing stone. There is no wall 
edema or
pericholecystic fluid; hypoechogenicity in the gallbladder fossa 
is more
compatible with fatty sparing as opposed to pericholecystic 
fluid. No
sonographic ___ sign was elicited. The CBD measures 6 mm in 
caliber.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis secondary findings to suggest acute 
cholecystitis; top
normal CBD without intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
2. Mild fatty infiltration of the liver.

___
CXR:
FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. No subdiaphragmatic free air is demonstrated.
 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

___
Renal Ultrasound:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.4 cm and the left kidney 
10.2 cm
without evidence of hydronephrosis, stones or obstructing 
masses. Mild
pelviectasis of the left kidney of unclear significance. There 
is no renal or perirenal fluid collection. The urinary bladder 
is normal.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild left pelviectasis of unclear clinical significance. CT 
would be more sensitive in detecting ureteral stone.
2. No ___ hydronephrosis.
3. No renal or perirenal fluid collection. 

___
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS

CT ABDOMEN: There is ___ consolidation in the 
right base
which could represent developing or resolving infection. There 
is bilateral
moderate right greater than left pleural effusions associated 
with compressive atelectasis. The heart is normal in size 
without pericardial effusion.
 
The liver demonstrates no focal lesion. Trace ___ 
fatty
infiltration may be present. The gallbladder is distended, 
containing a large 2-cm stone near the neck. There is, however, 
no pericholecystic stranding or fluid. The CBD measures 7 mm. 
Trace simple perihepatic fluid is noted. The spleen, pancreas, 
and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Small and large bowel loops 
are normal in caliber and opacify normally with contrast.
 
The left kidney is enlarged and demonstrates delayed nephrogram 
with respect to the right kidney, with mild perinephric 
stranding and transcortical bands of hypoenhancement, for 
example (601B, 33), overall appearance suggestive of 
pyelonephritis. Similarly in the right kidney, along the upper 
pole, there is ill-defined hypoattenuation (601B, 32), raising 
question of involvement of the right as well. There is no 
hydronephrosis or hydroureter. There is no free air. Great 
vessels are patent. Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in 
the infrarenal aorta extending into branching vessels.
 
CT PELVIS: The bladder, distal ureters, uterus, adnexa, and 
rectum appear
within normal limits. There is no inguinal or pelvic side wall 
adenopathy.
No free fluid in pelvis.
 
BONE WINDOW: No focal concerning lesion. Multilevel thoracic and 
lumbar
spondylosis is present, a large almost bridging osteophyte is 
present anterior
to L3-4.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings highly concerning for bilateral pyelonephritis, left 
worse than
right.
2. Small ___ right lower lung consolidation 
with moderate
right greater than left pleural effusion. Question evolving or 
resolving
infection.
3. Cholelithiasis without CT evidence to suggest cholecystitis.
4. Trace perihepatic fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo female with asymptomatic cholelithiasis present 
with epigastric abdominal pain for likely gastroenteritis and 
pyelonephritis/UTI. 
.
# Urinary tract infection/Pyelonephritis. The patient presented 
with a fever to 103, WBC to 18.6 with 91.9 %PMN, and complaining 
of abdominal pain.  Her UA was grossly positive, although she 
was asymptomatic.  She was started on Cipro 500mg PO and 
Ceftriaxone 1g IV in the ED.  She became borderline hypotensive 
to 94/51 and she was given 2L NS with blood pressure increased 
to 120's. Patient was also given famotidine, maalox, Donnatol, 
and Viscous Lidocaine in the ED with no effect.  After 
admission, the patient was continued on ceftriaxone for coverage 
of her UTI, but continued to spike fevers and had a rising WBC 
up to 21.6 for two days after admission. Although her vitals 
remained stable throughout her hospital stay. Additional imaging 
was obtained which revealed bilateral pyelonephritis with L>R 
via CT scan.    Her antibiotic were switch from ceftriaxone to 
Zosyn on day 2 after she continued to spike fever.  Her initial 
urine culture grew back pan-sensitive E. coli, but a repeat 
culture 48 hours after admission was negative.  After the 
patient defervesced and her initial culture came back, her 
antibiotics were narrowed to Cipro.  She was discharge with 9 
additional days of Cipro, to complete a 14 day course of 
antibiotics for pyelonephritis.
.
# Abdominal pain: The patient was asymptomatic from her UTI, but 
complained of abdominal pain for 4 days after admission.  She 
presented after multiple episodes of nb/nb emesis a few days 
prior to admission.  She had multiple family member who were 
also sick, and it was speculated that the patient had succumb to 
the current outbreak of norovirus.  Patient with history of 
cholelithiasis, u/s did not show signs of cholecystits.  Lipase 
negative.  She also constipated on admission and she was given 
an aggressive bowel regime and stooled daily after admission, 
but this did not improve her abdominal pain.  It is also 
possible she had referred pain from her bilateral 
pyelonephritis.
.
# Acute kidney injury secondary to hypovolemia- The patient 
presented with a slightly elevated Cr to 1.3, which improve to 
her baseline of 0.7-0.9 after IVF hydration.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service after 
he was admitted status post motor vehicle collision with a tree. 
 There was a prolonged extrication time.  He was transferred to 
___ for evaluation and further management.  On admission, he 
alcohol level was 188.  Imaging of his spine and head were 
negative for any acute process.  He was found to have 
right-sided rib fractures (___), a left distal ulnar fracture 
and questionable left tibial fracture.  That lower extremity 
injury was later found to be a cortical diaphysis disruption (no 
fracture) with soft tissue injury (open laceration).  The 
patient was admitted to the inpatient ward for continued 
management and observation.

Mr. ___ left upper extremity was placed in a short-arm 
cast by the orthopedic surgery service.  His right lower 
extremity wound was irrigated and required no operative 
management.  The patient was given IV cefazolin for the RLE 
injury.  He was initially kept NPO until it was determined that 
he would not need operative intervention.  After that time, he 
was started on a regular diet, which he tolerated without issue. 
 He was given parenteral and enteral analgesics.  He required 
little to no opioid analgesics during his admission.  In 
preparation for discharge, his IV antibiotics were discontinued 
and per Orthopedics recommendations, he was given a prescription 
for a seven day course of cephalexin.

Prior to discharge, Mr. ___ was seen by Physical Therapy and 
Occupational Therapy.  The patient was weight bearing as 
tolerated to his lower extremities.  He ambulated well and 
required no devices for assistance.  He was instructed to bear 
no weight to his LUE until follow up with Orthopedics.  
Occupational therapy felt that he had no cognitive issues nor 
impairments of his tactile/physical functioning of the LUE.  
Both services recommended discharge to home.

At the time of discharge, Mr. ___ was a febrile, 
hemodynamically stable and in no acute distress. Appointments 
were scheduled for the patient to follow-up with ACS and 
Orthpedics.  Instructions included care for the patient's LUE 
cast.

Discharge Diagnosis:
- Right ___ minimally displaced rib fractures
- Right pulmonary contusion
- Non-displaced left ulna fracture
- Right tibial fracture 
- Anterior right upper, middle, and lower lobe pulmonary 
contusions
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.
 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ on 
___ after you were involved in an automobile accident.  You 
also lost consciousness.  You were transferred to ___ for 
further evaluation and observation.  Specifically, you were 
found to have the following injuries:

- Right ___ minimally displaced rib fractures
- Right pulmonary contusion
- Non-displaced left ulna fracture
- Right tibial fracture 

Prior to discharge, you were seen by physical therapy and 
occupational therapy.  Both services recommend that you could be 
discharged safely to home.

In regards to your rib fractures, they can cause you to take 
shallow breaths because of the pain. You should take your pain 
medicine as as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you 
won't be able to take deep breaths.  

Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs. 

Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.

Do NOT smoke.

Return to the ED right away for any acute shortness of breath, 
increased pain or crackling sensation around your rips 
(crepitus).

You may take non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs to control 
the pain (i.e. Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) or 
Tylenol.

In regards to your Orthopedic injuries:
You were seen by the orthopedics service.  Your left arm was 
placed in a short arm case but required no operative fixation.  
Your right leg also required no surgical intervention.  Your 
soft tissue/skin wound was covered with gauze and treated 
conservatively.

CAST CARE
- Do not bear any weight with your left arm until you follow up 
with the orthopedic service (appointment below).
- Cast care:  Do not remove the splint.  
Check your cast every day: Contact your primary healthcare 
provider if you notice cracks, dents, holes, or flaking. 

Keep your cast clean and dry: Cover your cast with a towel when 
you eat. You may have a small piece of cast that can be removed 
to check on incisions under your cast. Make sure the small piece 
of cast is kept tightly closed. If your cast gets dirty, use a 
mild detergent and a damp washcloth to wipe off the outside of 
your cast. Continue to cover your cast with trash bags to keep 
it dry while you bathe. 

Care for the edges of your cast: Cover the cast edges to keep 
them smooth. Use 4 inch pieces of waterproof tape. Place one end 
of the tape under the inside edge of your cast and fold it over 
to the outside surface. Overlap tape strips until the edges are 
completely covered. Change the tape as directed. Do not pull or 
repair any of the padding from inside the cast. This could cause 
blisters and sores on the skin under your cast. 

Keep weight off your cast: Do not let anyone push down or lean 
on your cast. This may cause it to break.

Do not use sharp objects: Do not use a sharp or pointed object 
to scratch under your cast. This may cause wounds that can get 
infected, or you may lose the item inside the cast. If your skin 
itches, blow cool air under the cast. You may also gently 
scratch your skin outside the cast with a cloth. 

Contact your primary healthcare provider ___: 

Something falls into your cast and gets stuck.

You have itching, pain, burning, or weakness in the casted body 
area. 

You have a fever. 

You have sores, blisters, or breaks on the skin around the edges 
of the cast.

You have questions or concerns about your condition or care.

Seek care immediately or call ___ if: 

Your cast breaks or gets damaged. 

You see drainage, or your cast is stained or smells bad. 

Your skin turns blue or pale. 

Your skin tingles, burns, or is cold or numb. 

You have severe pain that is getting worse and does not go away 
after you take pain medicine. 

There is no space between your skin and the cast, and your cast

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Polyarticular arthritis involving left knee and ankle - 
initially appeared to ___ MD to be superficial cellulitis 
overlying knee, which had failed outpt Keflex. He was started on 
empiric Vancomycin with no improvement. Joint fluid cultures 
remained negative, and, interestingly there were no crystals. 
The patiennt has a history of gout and his uric acid level was 
elevated (though he does have mild renal failure). It is 
possible that this was osteoarthritis but there was more 
inflammation clinically than one would expect with that 
disorder. He also developed left ankle pain, swelling, 
tenderness and inflammation (significant). This, he stated, was 
the usual course and location of his gouty attacks. So he was 
started on an empiric regimen of colchicine, carefully dosed for 
his renal dysfunction. NSAIDS were avoided due to his renal 
failure. On the colchicine he improved, without side effects. 
His dose was increased per his request because in the past, he 
had required higher doses of colchicine for control of his gout. 
___ tolerated this quite well. Thiazide diuretics were 
discontinued. Potassium and magnesium were repleted. Physical 
therapy saw him and cleared him for home discharge.

2. Chronic kidney disease, stage II
 - Baseline Cr 1.5, down to 1.3 by discharge.

3. Hypertension
 - HCTZ was discontinued given the renal failure and acute gout. 
Atenolol and Amlodipine were continued.

4. Diabetes mellitus, type II, uncontrolled with complications 
(renal disease)
 - continued Lantus, glyburide was changed to glipizide.

5. Hyperlipidemia
 - continue atorvastatin

Discharge disposition - home with services; clinically improved
 
Medications on Admission:

HTN
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent with crutches. 
Weightbearing as tolerated on left leg.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were diagnosed with gout of your left knee and ankle. 

STOP Colchicine if you are taking any of the following 
medications: erythromycin, clarithromycin, fluconazole, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, verapamil, diltiazem, amprenavir, 
aprepitant, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin. Do NOT drink grapefruit 
juice while taking colchicine. Taking these medications or 
grapefruit juice with colchicine can cause a serious, even fatal 
reaction.

We stopped one of your medications called hydrochlorothiazide 
(HCTZ) because it can cause gouty attacks. Your primary care 
doctor may need to adjust your other blood pressure medications 
to compensate.

We also changed your diabetic oral medication from glyburide to 
glipizide due to the fact that glipizide may be better for 
patients with kidney problems like you. Continue to eat a 
diabetic diet, avoid alcohol, and check your blood sugar levels 
at least twice a day - preferably before each meal and at 
bedtime. Keep a log of your blood sugars and bring it with you 
to your appointments with your primary care doctor.

CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST

Reason: bleed, mass, stroke 
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old man with chronic hep C and HIV with new headache, 
confusion and gait ataxia 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
bleed, mass, stroke 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Chronic hepatitis C and HIV with headache.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced axial CT of the 
head.

FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or 
shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns, 
and sulci maintain a normal configuration. The gray-white matter 
differentiation is preserved without evidence for a large 
territorial infarction. The brain enhances normally without 
abnormal mass or fluid collection. The major intracranial 
vessels opacify normally. The osseous structures are 
unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The 
mastoid air cells are clear. Incidental note was made of a right 
concha bullosa.

IMPRESSION: No evidence for hemorrhage, mass effect, or abnormal 
enhancement. MR is more sensitive for meningitis.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o consolidation, infiltrates, effusions 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old man with HIV (CD4 390, VL UD ___, hep C cirrhosis 
p/w fevers, cough, HA. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o consolidation, infiltrates, effusions 
INDICATION: Fevers and cough and headache.

COMPARISON: None available. 

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are 
normal. There is no focal airspace opacification but there is 
linear atelectasis in the right upper lobe. There is no 
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Pulmonary vasculature is 
normal. No gross osseous abnormality.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. influenza B -- Initiated treatment with tamiflu during 
hospital stay.  No other source of infection identified with 
CSF, CXR, CT head, blood and urine cultures.  As he was able to 
eat a regular diet, he was discharged home.  There was some 
difficulty for him to fill his tamiflu after discharge, so I am 
unsure if he was able to finish the last three days.  He was 
clinically stable, however, and I do not think it will change 
his course of illness.

2. headache -- Further history reveals the onset of his symptoms 
after lifting an armoir.  His pain is likely musculoskeletal, 
and we discussed using heat and ice packs as well as tylenol for 
relief.  If the pain does not improve over the next days to 
weeks, he should follow up with his primary physician for more 
evaluation.

3. HIV -- continued Atripla.
 
Medications on Admission:
Atipla

ERCP ___:
The scout film revealed cholecystectomy clips.
Evidence of widely patent prior sphincterotomy was noted.
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with a Rx Sphincterotome.
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts.
Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree.
Cholangiogram showed moderate diffuse dilation but no filling 
defects.
Cystic duct did not opacify.
Several balloon sweeps were performed with no sludge or pus.
Although there was no endoscopic evidence of cholangitis, given 
the sudden clinical decompensation and instability, a 10FX5cm 
double pigtail stent was placed to ensure a biliary source is 
not contributing to the overall clinical picture.
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically.
I supervised the acquisition and interpretation of the 
fluoroscopic images.
The quality of the fluoroscopic images was good
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

ERCP ___:
The scout film showed a plastic stent in the RUQ.
A plastic stent was emerging from the major papilla. The stent 
was successfully removed using a snare. Evidence of previous 
sphincterotomy was seen at the major papilla as well as small 
amounts of pus and a small diverticulum next to the papilla.
The CBD was successfully cannulated by using a sphincterotome Rx 
preloaded with a 0.035in guidewire.
Contrast injection revealed no filling defect however the right 
hepatic ducts were difficult to visualize.  
Spyglass cholangioscopy was performed. The bile duct was 
examined. The bifurcation was visualized and was normal. The 
main right hepatic duct was seen and was normal. A large stone 
was seen completely obstructing the takeoff of the posterior 
right hepatic duct.
Electro hydraulic lithotripsy (___) was done for fragmentation 
of the large stone. Large amonts of pus were seen as the stone 
was being fragmented. The stone was eventually completely 
fragmented and a guidewire passed into the posterior right 
hepatic duct. Minimal contrast injection showed dilated 
intrahepatic ducts, proximal to the previous location of the 
stone.  
The CBD was swept multiple times using a Rx extraction balloon. 
Multiple stone fragments and pus were successfully removed.
The decision was made to place a stent into the posterior right 
hepatic duct to help with biliary drainage. A ___ x 5cm plastic 
double pigtail biliary stent was successfully placed. There was 
excellent contrast and bile drainage at the end of the 
procedure.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old ___ man with A Fib not on 
anticoagulation, chronic HBV infection, HTN, & history of 
cholangitis s/p cholecystectomy in ___ who presented with 
abdominal pain & septic shock with evidence of acute ascending 
cholangitis. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
======================
1. Ascending cholangitis:
-Patient started on ceftriaxone+flagyl on admission w/ ERCP ___ 
w/placement of stent followed by repeat ERCP ___ w/ stone 
removal and replacement of stent w/ overall improvement of his 
symptoms.  Following ERCP he had a short stay in the ICU due to 
transient septic shock, respiratory failure, A fib RVR, and 
lactic acidosis requiring vasopressors and broadening of 
antibiotics to meropenem.  With overall clinical improvement and 
stability he was transitioned to PO ciprofloxacin with plans for 
total 5 days antibiotics post-ERCP through ___.  

2. A fib RVR
-Patient with paroxysmal A fib with development of A fib RVR 
following ERCP with septic shock.  HR improved with resolution 
of sepsis but his home metoprolol succinate was uptitrated from 
25mg daily to 100mg daily.  He has continued to decline 
anticoagulation; recommend continued discussion with PCP.  
Continued on aspirin 81mg daily. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
========================
1. Chronic HBV infection: continued tenofovir. Follow up with 
___, MD.
2. HTN: continue metoprolol  
3. Thrombocytopenia: stable, since ___. Mild. No signs of 
bleeding. Negative parasite smear; low suspicion for malaria. 

>30 minutes spent on discharge planning 

RESOLVED INPATIENT PROBLEMS: 
============================
# Lactic acidosis 
# Concern for congestive heart failure, unspecified type: 
pro-BNP elevated and dypsneic, though suspect hypervolemia 
secondary to fluid resuscitation in setting of cholangitis. 
Respirations improved after single dose, 20 mg IV furosemide. 
TTE normal
study, ___.  

MICU COURSE:
===========
The patient was transferred to the MICU for airway monitoring 
given tachypnea, wheezing, and lactic acidosis. Shortly after 
transfer, the patient became hypentensive and tachycardic. EKG 
demonstrated Afib with RVR. He was started on Phenylephrine and 
Metoprolol. Initially concern for PE. However, CTA was negative 
for PE. Troponin was mildly elevated to 0.04, but downtrending. 
The tachypnea and wheezing resolved shortly after transfer. 
Phenylephrine was weaned within a few hours after transfer, 
lactate was downtrending. Per the patient's family, he has had 
similar episodes over the last ___ years. The underlying cause 
is not known.

The patient experienced a similar episode overnight. He became 
acutely tachycardic to 150s-160s, was rigoring and having upper 
respiratory wheezing. He was given a total 10mg IV metoprolol 
and his HR came down to ___. He was also given 1mg IV 
Ativan for agitation and relaxed a little. Lactate 5.9 from 1.8. 
No STE on EKG. CXR unchanged. Rigoring stopped, never spiked a 
fever. When acute episode resolved he was very confused 
afterwards. 1L given during acute episode

Given that his respiratory distress has resolved and he remains 
hemodynamically stable, he can be transferred to a regular 
nursing floor for further care.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized for abdominal pain. You were found to have 
a stone blocking your bile ducts. You had an ERCP twice to 
remove the blockage. You were quite sick, and briefly needed to 
stay in the intensive care unit. We treated you with IV 
antibiotics, and switched to oral antibiotics to finish. 

You were also found to have a fast heart rate. It was irregular 
(""atrial fibrillation"", which you had before). You should talk 
with your doctor about blood thinner medication to lower your 
risk for stroke in the future. 

Please take your medications as prescribed on the attached sheet 
& follow up with your doctors, as below. 

We wish you best wishes in your recovery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo right handed woman with no past medical
history of hypertension and migraines with presents with
intermittant episodes of right sided numbness without clear
reports of weakness.  These events are not always associated 
with
headache, but the most recent symptoms have been.  She has a
strong history of migraine headaches, though they are a bit
different in quality from her current, dull, right sided
headache.  She has not had a typical migraine in several months
but has had these events in that time period.  It is possible
that these events are a migranious varient for this patient. 
That said, the patient does have a family history of possible
MELAS which raises the possibility ther her symptoms may be a
manifestation of this disorder.  The patient is currently
visiting from out of town and because of the inability to
expidite neurologic evaluation in ___, we will complete this work
up with imaging at this time.

upon further questioning patient described the ""numbness"" as a 
""pins and needles"" sensation more consistant with positive 
symptoms that spread up her arm over the course of minutes.  
These symtpoms along with the headache appear most likely to the 
diagnosis of complicated migraines. 

Patient was instructed to start on verapamil for migraine 
prophylaxis and continue with tylenol and or over the counter 
motrin for her breakthrough headaches. She was instructed to 
follow up in the ___ for further follow 
up.  She was also given instructions to start with a migraine 
diary.  

Patient did have an MRI/A performed to rule out any vascular 
component to these symptoms.  Both studies were unreveiling.  On 
exam she also demonstrated some weakness in C4 and C7 and 
therefore a cervalgia component to the headaches an symptoms is 
also likely.  Patient was recommended a hard wheat pillow and a 
cervical soft collar to sleep with.   

MRI
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. Minimal nonspecific 
foci of T2 
hyperintensity in the white matter. 
  
MRA HEAD: 
  
Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of 
anterior and 
posterior circulation. No evidence of vascular occlusion, 
stenosis or an 
aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size seen. 
  
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head. 
  
MRA NECK: 
  
Neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the carotid and 
vertebral 
arteries. No evidence of stenosis or occlusion seen.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You presented with repeated episodes of right sided numbness and 
tingling sensation.  An MRI and MRA was which was unreveiling 
for any parenchymal or vascular abnormality.  Therefore, it 
appears likely that these symptoms are related to a complex 
migraine syndrome.  You were started on low dose verapamil to be 
taken in the morning for migraine prophylaxis.  As you blood 
pressure is low, if you begin to feel light headed you should 
stop taking the medication and notify your PCP. 

You were also found to have a weakness in your C5 and C7 
distribution.  This is most likely related to an underlying 
cervical cephalgia.  You were given a cervical soft collar and 
instructed to use a hard wheat pillow in correction of this.

You should follow up with Drs ___ for further 
follow up.

with 40% ostial stenosis, third obtuse marginal ostial 60% 
stenosis. RCA also had proximal 50% stenosis. It was recommended 
that he be transferred to a tertiary facility for intervention 
of the above and valve repair. 

While he was awaiting transfer, he had acute worsening of his 
respiratory symptoms overnight (___), requiring transfer to 
the ICU, intubated and mechanically ventilated for acute on 
chronic systolic heart failure. Chest x-ray consistent with 
acute pulmonary edema. Notably, per hospital records the patient 
received over 2L fluid on ___ around time of left heart 
cath.

Additional doses of Lasix was administered, and he was 
hypotensive post-intubation requiring Neo infusion (significant 
tachycardia was noted with dopamine infusion). Tertiary care 
facilities contacted for transfer.

Patient also treated for UTI and pneumonia at OSH, had been on 
Zosyn and Vancomycin started ___.

Most recently at ___ on furosemide 80 mg twice a day IV.

Found to have severe AS and three vessel disease on LHC, 
developed pulmonary edema requiring intubation. He was 
transferred to ___ for PCI and underwent a repeat LHC w/ 
successful DES to the LAD. Patient also had posturing that was 
initially concerning for a seizure vs. stroke. However, both CT 
head and an MRI showed no acute process and an EEG showed no 
evidence of a seizure.Patient was unable to be weaned off 
pressors subsequently developed a mixed septic/cardiogenic shock 
___ to severe MR and HCAP which were treated with broad spectrum 
antibiotics and aggressive diuresis with minimal improvement. He 
continued to spike fevers without a clear source. Imaging was 
not revealing. He also developed a new onset of atrial 
fibrillation for which he was rate-controlled and 
anticoagulated. Mechanical ventilation could also not be weaned 
as the patient developed ___ respirations without full 
ventilation support. Despite being on multiple pressors,

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with history of HFpEF, mitral 
valve disease s/p mechanical MVR on high-dose warfarin due to 
warfarin resistance, CAD, HTN, HLD, DMII, COPD who presents with 
bright red blood per rectum.

#Diverticulosis, GI bleed, acute blood loss anemia:
Patient presented with bright red blood per rectum. CT A/P with 
contrast at OSH on ___ showed sigmoid diverticulosis but no 
evidence of active bleeding. Patient also has history of 
mechanical MVR and warfarin resistance requiring high dose 
warfarin (35mg) for target INR of 2.5-3.5. On presentation, INR 
was 3.7 and Hgb was 7.9. Hgb remained stable throughout 
hospitalization, she required no blood transfusion while at 
___, and patient received EGD (which was significant for 
antral erosions) and colonoscopy that revealed extensive 
diverticulosis but no active bleeding. She had a stool h.pylori 
ordered that was not resulted at the time of discharge. Patient 
then remained without active bleeding for the rest of her 
hospitalization and Hgb trended upward- was 8.5 on day of 
discharge.

#Abdominal Pain: Presented with cramping abdominal pain after 2 
weeks of antibiotics for ileocolitis and resolution of original 
pain. CT on ___ showed no signs of ongoing colitis, but patient 
continued to have new pain. Pain was treated with home 
medications, including tramadol, in an otherwise opioid-sparing 
pain regimen, given patient's history of hospital-enabled opioid 
use disorder.

#Opioid Use Disorder: Patient had been previously started on 
tramadol iso of osteoarthritis. Patient has multiple other 
stressors in her life including recent divorce and loneliness. 
Made mentions of helplessness while inpatient. All of this may 
be compounding her experience of physical pain and creating her 
want for more medications. Following up possible solutions to 
opioid use will be necessary to ensure optimal outcomes in the 
future.

#Mitral Regurgitation s/p Mechanical MVR:
Given warfarin resistance is maintained on ___ of warfarin 
daily. Presented with INR of 3.0. She was given smaller doses of 
warfarin as inpatient to have INR brought down to 2.5 for 
___. Had an INR of 2.3 (subtherapeutic) on day of 
discharge. Was thus bridged with Lovenox, given home dose of 
warfarin, and discharged with instructions for daily INR at 
___ rehab facility. Once INR 2.5 or higher, can 
discontinue Lovenox.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
#Paroxysmal Afib: Maintained normal sinus rhythm while 
inpatient. Continued home metoprolol and warfarin.

#Chronic HFpEF: Euvolemic at presentation. Home furosemide, 
lisinopril, and metoprolol continued. 

#Chest Pain: Patient w/ history of single-vessel CAD- presented 
initially with atypical chest pain. Pain was non-exertional (had 
normal ekg and negative enzymes). Resolved with home Lorazepam. 
Chest pain free for several days prior to discharge

#CAD: Continued home statin, metoprolol, and asa while 
inpatient. 

#COPD: No evidence of acute exacerbation while inpatient. 

#HTN: Home BP medications continued. 

#DMII: ISS continued in house. Metformin held inpatient but OK 
to resume on discharge.

#Anxiety: Continued home Ativan. 

#Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Continued CPAP at night. 

#OA of the R knee: Continued home gabapentin and tramadol. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[] Patient will need daily INR checks to ensure that her INR is 
between 2.5-3.5. If her INR is 2.5 or above, can discontinue 
Lovenox, and continue to titrate warfarin as necessary for INR 
goal. Of note, history of warfarin resistance requiring very 
high doses.
[] Avoid Narcotics for pain relief as possible
[] F/u w/ PCP after discharge from Rehab
[] F/u H. pylori antigen test

CXR (PA,LAT): IMPRESSION: Rapid development of large peripheral 
mass-like opacity in left 
upper lobe, with probable adjacent area of loculated pleural 
fluid. Major 
diagnostic considerations include pulmonary infarction and acute 
pulmonary 
infection. As discussed with Dr. ___, as the patient currently 
does not 
have infectious symptoms, CTA of the chest is suggested to 
evaluate for 
possible infarct. Although a neoplastic process could produce 
similar 
findings, the rapid development since ___ would be 
unusual for a 
primary lung malignancy. 

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Rounded 3 cm mass in the left upper lobe abutting the pleural 
surface, 
with a relative paucity of vasculature in this area. This could 
represent an 
infarcted lung, which is now evolving. However, no current 
pulmonary 
embolism/thrombus is identified. This lesion is unlikely to be a 
primary lung 
neoplasm given its rapid development since ___. 
Additionally, a 
necrotic malignant metastatic lesion is also thought to be less 
likely given 
that this is a solitary finding. 
  
2. Small airways disease, progressed from ___. 
  
3. Area of distortion and soft tissue density along the right 
minor fissure, 
which likely reflects scarring. However, interval followup is 
recommended to 
assess stability. 
  
4. Small left pleural effusion. 
  
5. Hiatal hernia with a patulous fluid filled distal esophagus. 
  
Findings posted to the ED dashboard at the time of 
interpretation.  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


 
Brief Hospital Course:
Cough w/hemoptysis: Patient was kept on respiratory precautions 
for TB. CXR showed a mass-like opacity in left upper lobe, with 
probable adjacent area of loculated pleural fluid. Levofloxacin 
was started to cover possible community-acquired pneumonia. 
Flagyl was added to cover GN bacteria, as patient has 
long-standing cough likely due to GERD. Pulmonary service was 
consulted and recommended biopsy of lesion. Heparin drip was 
discontinued as suspicion of pulmonary embolus, infarct was low. 
Induced sputum was collected for microbiology and AFB cultures. 
CT guided biopsy of the lung provided 8ml of fluctuant fluid 
which, on gram stain showed 3+ Gram + cocci in pairs and 1+ 
leukocytes. PPD was placed on day of admission. AFB cultures 
were pending on discharge, however no AFB was seen on smear. The 
patient did not experience hemoptysis during his admission and 
his cough symptoms improved. He was encouraged to ___ with 
his PCP for ___ of his PPD. A scheduled appointment was made 
with his pulmonologist for further work-up of his lung lesion.

GERD: Patient has history of GERD and Barretts esophagitis. He 
noted chronic cough occurring mostly at night. His outpatient 
PPI was continued during admission. A ___ appointment was 
made with his gastroenterologist for further work-up of cough 
and GERD. 
 
Bipolar: Patient remained stable on lamictal and celexa together 
without mood switch. He remained stable throught his stay.

encephalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy.
 .
# Recurrent encephalopathy:  Presentation secondary to 
inadequate bowel regimen while at rehab facility. Work up 
negative for infection (stool, blood, urine), GI bleed, and U/S 
failed to show significant ascites.  A CT of abdomen was done to 
evaluate questionable poor flow through the portal vein seen on 
US.  The CT was sig for patent portal vein.  Patient was treated 
with rifaximin and Q2hr lactulose and produced ~4L of stools per 
day.  Mental status improved to baseline on discharge.  Cipro 
was continued for SBP prophylaxis. He was also continued on his 
vegetarian diet.  A decision was made to discharge patient home 
w/ services as mother felt that she could provide better care at 
home.  Physical therapy was consulted who agreed that the 
patient could be discharged home.
.

the setting of encephalopathy and high stool output. Resolved 
with free water replacement.
.  
# ESLD. Secondary EtOH and HCV. Patient initially presented with 
improved ascites and edema. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed 
poor flow through the portal vein, and CT of the abdomen was 
done for further assessment.  The CT demonstrated patent portal 
vein.  Patient was continued on his lactulose and rifaximin as 
above.  He was also continued on cipro for SBP ppx, his home

TTE: 
Conclusions  
The left atrium is elongated. The left atrial volume index is 
severely increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 65 %). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant 
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. 
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation 
or other cellular elements. There is no echocardiographic 
evidence of tamponade. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size and global/regional 
systolic function. Moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. 
Small, echodense circumferential pericardial effusion.   

___:
IMPRESSION:  
  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower 
extremity veins. 

CXR
IMPRESSION:  
  
Low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly. Signs of mild to 
moderate chronic interstitial edema, combined 9 by small 
bilateral pleural effusions and subsequent areas of atelectasis. 
 No evidence of pneumonia. Old healed rib fractures.  No 
pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o HTN and hypothyroidism p/w DOE x1 day found to have 
elevated pro-BNP to 4000 and elevated lactate in the context of 
htn urgency with SBPs in 200s and UA grossly positive for 
infection leading to flash pulmonary edema. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#acute dCHF: The pt presented with dyspnea, evidence of volume 
overload on exam most noteably for pulmonary edema and a CXR c/w 
acute CHF. An ECHO showed preserved ventricular function 
(LVEF>65%) thereby qualifying this as dCHF. It was likely 
precipitated by htn urgency with a component of demand from her 
UTI. She was given lasix 40 mg IV x1 and diuresed very well 
(~2L). She had subsequent decreases in her O2 requirement and 
she was weaned to room air. Her lisinopril was increased to 20 
mg PO BID. Discharged on 20 mg PO lasix and supplemental Mg, 
with d/c weight of 44.4 kg.

#HTN Urgency: upon presentation at the OSH, the pt had SBP in 
200s and was placed on a nitro gtt. Upon arrival to ___, her 
blood pressures were more stable and did not require a nitro 
gtt. Her lisinopril was increased to 20 mg PO BID. Home HCTZ was 
stopped.

#UTI: grossly positive UA at OSH and she was given 1 dose of 
ceftriaxone. Urine cultures speciated to E coli sensitive to 
ceftriaxone and bactrim. She was continued on ceftriaxone while 
she was an in patient and finished a 5d course.

#Anemia: Hb/Hct 8.7/27.3. Stable here, but at OSH was 10.3. No 
s/s of GIB, stool per nursing was not melanotic. This was 
trended here.

___: Cr up to 1.3 from baseline 1.0. In context of diuresis, 
likely pre-renal. Resolved prior to d/c.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

#Hypothyroidism: continued on home levothyroxine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Blood Pressure: ensure pt is adequately treated as her 
hypertensive urgency likely precipitated her flash pulmonary 
edema.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Blood Pressure: ensure pt is adequately treated as her 
hypertensive urgency likely precipitated her flash pulmonary 
edema
-Needs electrolyte monitoring, next check should be on ___
-D/c'd on supplemental Mg
-Continue to assess volume status with daily weights, need for 
lasix titration; discharged on 20 mg PO lasix 
-Can start 5 mg of amlodipine if blood pressures are sustained 
greater than 150 mm Hg
-Lisinopril dose increased, HCTZ stopped

At discharge she was advised to monitor closely for diarrhea 
given recent hx of C. Diff. Given the history of choking on 
cough drop and medications at home, she was evaluated with a 
speech and swallow to look for evidence of aspiration. While 
there was evidence of aspiration on bedside swallow eval, a 
follow-up video swallow was negative for aspiration and she was 
discharged home with nor restrictions/aspiration precautions

PATHOLOGY
___ BM BIOPSY
**BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:
DIAGNOSIS: CELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH ERYTHROID PREDOMINANT 
MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF 
INVOLVEMENT BY ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA 
**CYTOGENETICS: Negative for MLL, NEGATIVE for DELETION 5q31 or 
MONSOMY 5. Negative for monsomy 7. Normal female karyotype.
**FLOW: RESULTS: 10-color analysis with linear side scatter vs. 
CD45 gating was used to evaluate lymphocytes and blasts. The 
viability of the analyzed nondebris events done by 7-AAD is 98%. 
No abnormal events are identified in the ""blast gate."" CD34+ 
myeloblasts with a normal immunophenotype represent only 1% of 
total viable events.
INTERPRETATION: Diagnostic immunophenotypic features of 
involvement by leukemia are not seen in specimen. Correlation 
with clinical findings and morphology (see separate pathology 
report ___-___) is recommended. Flow cytometry 
immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal populations due to 
topography, sampling or artifacts of simple preparation.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with hx of AML s/p 7+3 induction 
and HiDAC admitted for matched related donor stem cell 
transplant.

# Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Patient is MLL+ indicating high risk 
genetics. She is s/p 7+3 induction and HiDAC consolidation. 
Recent BM bx on ___ showed no residual disease. She underwent 
busulfan/cytoxan conditioning which she tolerated well. She 
underwent MRD allogeneic stem cell transplantation on ___. 
Her post-transplant course was notable for neutropenic fever: 
she developed a fever on ___ with no localizing signs of 
symptoms, and was started on cefepime. She again became febrile 
on ___ and vancomycin was added. Antibiotics were discontinued 
on ___ as her counts had recovered and she was no longer 
febrile. Course also notable for mild mucositis treated with low 
dose oxycodone and lidocaine mouthwash. She continued on 
acyclovir, fluconazole prophylaxis while neutropenic; she was 
started on Bactrim on day +21. She was started on ursodiol for 
prevention of SODS.  She was immunosuppressed with cyclosporin. 
On the day of discharge she was day 21 post transplant and 
counts reflected engraftment.

# Abdominal pain: On ___ she developed diffuse abdominal 
pain. LFTs were normal, amylase and lipase were normal, and CT 
scan was negative for acute process. Her pain abated within 24 
hours without specific intervention. This may have represented 
menstrual cramps or constipation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Immunosuppression: She will need to continue cyclosporin. 
Current dose is 75 BID, last trough checked ___ was 188 and 
dose was not changed at that time.
-Infection prophylaxis: She will continue acyclovir, 
fluconazole. She started PCP prophylaxis with bactrim on the day 
of discharge (post-transplant day 21); please monitor LFTs on 
this 
-She will continue on ursodiol for prevention of sino-occlusive 
disease until at least day +100
-She will need ongoing magnesium repletion at follow up visits.
-She will need topical estrogens.
